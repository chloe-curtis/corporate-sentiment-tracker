       "      <td>ITEM 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \\n\\nKey Trends and Economic Factors Affecting Ford and the Automotive Industry \\n \\n Production and Supply Chain. Although we saw improvements in our supply chain throughout 2023, including easing of the semiconductor shortage, we continue to face some production issues due to, among other things, labor shortages at our suppliers. Moreover, we have received and continue to receive claims from our supply base related to inflationary pressure and production disruption. Upon receipt, we evaluate those claims, and, in certain circumstances, in order to ensure continuity of supply and mitigate the impact on our production, have made payments to our suppliers, sometimes under duress. We continue to reevaluate our supply base and sourcing decisions and may in the future incur charges to improve flexibility and cost competitiveness. \\n \\n Currency Exchange Rate Volatility. Globally, central banks have begun shifting from tightening policy by raising interest rates to holding rates steady or, in some markets, beginning to cut rates. As they do, they need to carefully balance the risk that inflation remains elevated against the heightened financial and economic risks associated with high interest rates. This is notable for many emerging markets, which may also face increased exposure to commodity prices and political instability, contributing to unpredictable movements in the value of their exchange rates. In addition to direct impacts on the financial flows of global automotive companies, currency movements can also impact pricing of vehicles exported to overseas markets. In most markets, exchange rates are market-determined, and all are impacted by many different macroeconomic and policy factors, and thus likely to remain volatile. However, in some markets, exchange rates are heavily influenced or controlled by governments. \\n \\n Pricing Pressure. Despite vehicle pricing remaining elevated over the last year due to strong demand, supply shortages, and inflationary costs, we have already observed moderation in the rate of new and used vehicle price increases as auto production recovers from the semiconductor shortage, but it is unclear whether prices will decline fully to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. Over the long term, intense competition and excess capacity are likely to put downward pressure on inflation-adjusted prices for similarly-contented vehicles and contribute to a challenging pricing environment for the automotive industry in most major markets. \\n \\n Electric Vehicle Market. Although we continue to invest in our electric vehicle strategy, we have observed lower-than-anticipated industrywide electric vehicle adoption rates and near-term pricing pressures, which has led us and may in the future lead us to adjust our spending, production, and/or product launches to better match the pace of electric vehicle adoption. As a result of the lower-than-anticipated adoption rates, near-term pricing pressures, and other factors, we recorded about 0.7 billion of charges in 2023 and may continue to incur charges, which could be substantial, related to payments to our electric vehicle-related suppliers (battery, raw material, or otherwise), inventory adjustments, or other matters. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional discussion of the risks related to lower-than-anticipated electric vehicle volumes and our planned transition to a greater mix of electric vehicles. \\n \\n Commodity and Energy Prices. Prices for commodities remain volatile. In some cases, spot prices for various commodities have recently diverged somewhat, as anticipated weakening in global industrial activity mitigates price increases for base metals such as steel and aluminum, while precious metals (e.g., palladium), and raw materials that are used in batteries for electric vehicles (e.g., lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, among other materials, for batteries) remain elevated. The net impact on us and our suppliers has been higher material costs overall. To help ensure supply of raw materials for critical components (e.g., batteries), we, like others in the industry, have entered into multi-year sourcing agreements and may enter into additional agreements. Similar dynamics are impacting energy markets, with Europe particularly exposed to the risk of both higher prices and constraints on supply of natural gas due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Such shortages may impact facilities operated by us or our suppliers, which could have an impact on us in Europe and other regions. In the long term, the outcome of de-carbonization and electrification of the vehicle fleet may depress oil demand, but the global energy transition will also contribute to ongoing volatility of oil and other energy prices. \\n \\n Vehicle Profitability. Our financial results depend on the profitability of the vehicles we sell, which may vary significantly by vehicle line. In general, larger vehicles tend to command higher prices and be more profitable than smaller vehicles. For example, in Ford Blue, our larger, more profitable vehicles had an average contribution margin that was 139 of our total average contribution margin across all vehicles, whereas our smaller vehicles had significantly lower contribution margins. In addition, government regulations aimed at reducing emissions and increasing fuel efficiency (e.g., ZEV mandates and low emission zones), and other factors that accelerate the transition to electrified vehicles, may increase the cost of vehicles by more than the perceived benefit to consumers and dampen margins. \\n\\n40 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Trade Policy. To the extent governments in various regions implement or intensify barriers to imports, such as erecting tariff or non-tariff barriers or manipulating their currency, and provide advantages to local exporters selling into the global marketplace, there can be a significant negative impact on manufacturers based in other markets. While we believe the long-term trend will support the growth of free trade, we will continue to monitor and address the developing role that geopolitical, climate, and labor concerns are playing in trade relations. \\n \\n Inflation and Interest Rates. We continue to see near-term impacts on our business due to inflation, including ongoing global price pressures in the wake of geopolitical volatility, driving up energy prices, freight premiums, and other operating costs above normal rates. Although headline inflation in the United States and Europe appears to have peaked, as gasoline and natural gas prices recede from the latest spike, core inflation (excluding food and energy prices) remains elevated and is a source of continued cost pressure on businesses and households. Interest rates have increased significantly as central banks in developed countries attempt to subdue inflation while government deficits and debt remain at high levels in many global markets. Accordingly, the eventual implications of higher government deficits and debt, tighter monetary policy, and potentially higher long-term interest rates may drive a higher cost of capital for the business. At Ford Credit, rising interest rates may impact its ability to source funding and offer financing at competitive rates, which could reduce its financing margin. \\n \\n Revenue \\n \\n Company excluding Ford Credit revenue is generated primarily by sales of vehicles, parts, accessories, and services from our Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro segments. Revenue is recorded when control is transferred to our customers (generally, our dealers and distributors). For the majority of sales, this occurs when products are shipped from our manufacturing facilities. However, we defer a portion of the consideration received when there is a separate future or stand-ready performance obligation, such as extended service contracts or ongoing vehicle connectivity. Revenue related to extended service contracts is recognized over the term of the agreement in proportion to the costs we expect to incur in satisfying the contract obligations; revenue related to other future or stand-ready performance obligations is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the period in which services are expected to be performed. Vehicles sold to daily rental car companies with an obligation to repurchase at an agreed upon amount, exercisable at the option of the customer, are accounted for as operating leases, with lease revenue recognized over the term of the lease. Proceeds from the sale of vehicles at auction are recognized in revenue upon transfer of control of the vehicle to the buyer. \\n \\n Most of the vehicles sold by us to our dealers and distributors are financed at wholesale by Ford Credit. Upon Ford Credit originating the wholesale receivable related to a dealer s purchase of a vehicle, Ford Credit pays cash to the relevant Ford entity in payment of the dealer s obligation for the purchase price of the vehicle. The dealer then pays the wholesale finance receivable to Ford Credit when it sells the vehicle to a retail customer. \\n \\n Our Ford Credit segment revenue is generated primarily from interest on finance receivables and revenue from operating leases. Revenue from interest on finance receivables is recognized over the term of the receivable using the interest method and includes the amortization of certain deferred origination costs. Revenue from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. \\n \\n Transactions between Ford Credit and our other segments occur in the ordinary course of business. For example, we offer special retail financing and lease incentives to dealers customers who choose to finance or lease our vehicles from Ford Credit. The cost for these incentives is included in our estimate of variable consideration at the date the related vehicle sales to our dealers are recorded. In order to compensate Ford Credit for the lower interest or lease payments offered to the retail customer, we pay the discounted value of the incentive directly to Ford Credit when it originates the retail finance or lease contract with the dealer s customer. Ford Credit recognizes the incentive amount over the life of retail finance contracts as an element of financing revenue and over the life of lease contracts as a reduction to depreciation. See Note 1 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of transactions between Ford Credit and our other segments. \\n\\n41 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Costs and Expenses \\n \\n Our income statement classifies our Company excluding Ford Credit total costs and expenses into two categories: (i) cost of sales, and (ii) selling, administrative, and other expenses. We include within cost of sales those costs related to the development, production, and distribution of our vehicles, parts, accessories, and services. Specifically, we include in cost of sales each of the following: material costs (including commodity costs); freight costs; warranty, including product recall costs; labor and other costs related to the development and production of our vehicles and connectivity, parts, accessories, and services; depreciation and amortization; and other associated costs. We include within selling, administrative, and other expenses labor and other costs not directly related to the development and production of our vehicles, parts, accessories, and services, including such expenses as advertising and sales promotion costs. \\n \\n Certain of our costs, such as material costs, generally vary directly with changes in volume and mix of production. In our industry, production volume often varies significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. Quarterly production volumes experience seasonal shifts throughout the year (including peak retail sales seasons and the impact on production of model changeover and new product launches). Annual production volumes are heavily impacted by external economic factors, including the pace of economic growth and factors such as the availability of consumer credit and cost of fuel. \\n \\n As a result, we analyze the profit impact of certain cost changes holding constant present-year volume and mix and currency exchange, in order to evaluate our cost trends absent the impact of varying production and currency exchange levels. We analyze these cost changes in the following categories: \\n \\n Contribution Costs these costs typically vary with production volume. These costs include material (including commodity), warranty, and freight and duty costs. \\n \\n Structural Costs these costs typically do not have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume. These costs include manufacturing; vehicle and software engineering; spending-related; advertising and sales promotion; administrative, information technology, and selling; and pension and OPEB costs. \\n \\n While contribution costs generally vary directly in proportion to production volume, elements within our structural costs category are impacted to differing degrees by changes in production volume. We also have varying degrees of discretion when it comes to controlling the different elements within our structural costs. For example, depreciation and amortization expense largely is associated with prior capital spending decisions. On the other hand, while labor costs do not vary directly with production volume, manufacturing labor costs may be impacted by changes in volume, for example when we increase overtime, add a production shift, or add personnel to support volume increases. Other structural costs, such as advertising or engineering costs, do not necessarily have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume. Our structural costs generally are within our discretion, although to varying degrees, and can be adjusted over time in response to external factors. \\n \\n We consider certain structural costs to be a direct investment in future growth and revenue. For example, structural costs are necessary to grow our business and improve profitability, invest in new products and technologies, respond to increasing industry sales volume, and grow our market share. \\n \\n Cost of sales and Selling, administrative, and other expenses for full year 2023 were 161.3 billion. Company excluding Ford Credit s total material and commodity costs make up the largest portion of these costs and expenses, followed by structural costs. Although material costs are our largest absolute cost, our margins can be affected significantly by changes in any category of costs. \\n 42 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 2023 \\n \\n The net income attributable to Ford Motor Company was 4,347 million in 2023. Company adjusted EBIT was 10,416 million. \\n \\n Net income/(loss) includes certain items special items that are excluded from Company adjusted EBIT. These items are discussed in more detail in Note 26 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.

The flat year-over-year Company adjusted EBIT primarily reflects higher Ford Pro and Ford Blue EBIT and a lower EBIT loss in Ford Next. Offsets included higher EBIT losses in Ford Model e, lower past service pension and OPEB income in Corporate Other, and lower Ford Credit EBT. \\n \\n 44 \\n\\nItem 7.

The EBIT improvement was driven by higher net pricing, lower commodity costs, and higher wholesales. Partial offsets primarily include higher material costs (related to inflationary cost pressures, new products, and about 80 million of volume-related obligations for batteries), higher warranty costs (reflecting inflationary cost pressures and increased field service actions), and higher structural costs (including volume-related) and supplemental compensation (including the impact of the new UAW collective bargaining agreement). \\n 46 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Definitions and Information Regarding Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro Causal Factors \\n \\n In general, we measure year-over-year change in Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro segment EBIT using the causal factors listed below, with net pricing and cost variances calculated at present-year volume and mix and exchange: \\n \\n Market Factors (exclude the impact of unconsolidated affiliate wholesale units): \\n Volume and Mix primarily measures EBIT variance from changes in wholesale unit volumes (at prior-year average contribution margin per unit) driven by changes in industry volume, market share, and dealer stocks, as well as the EBIT variance resulting from changes in product mix, including mix among vehicle lines and mix of trim levels and options within a vehicle line \\n Net Pricing primarily measures EBIT variance driven by changes in wholesale unit prices to dealers and marketing incentive programs such as rebate programs, low-rate financing offers, special lease offers, and stock adjustments on dealer inventory \\n \\n Cost: \\n Contribution Costs primarily measures EBIT variance driven by per-unit changes in cost categories that typically vary with volume, such as material costs (including commodity and component costs), warranty expense, and freight and duty costs \\n Structural Costs primarily measures EBIT variance driven by absolute change in cost categories that typically do not have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume. Structural costs include the following cost categories: \\n Manufacturing, Including Volume-Related - consists primarily of costs for hourly and salaried manufacturing personnel, plant overhead (such as utilities and taxes), and new product launch expense. These costs could be affected by volume for operating pattern actions such as overtime, line-speed, and shift schedules \\n Engineering and Connectivity consists primarily of costs for vehicle and software engineering personnel, prototype materials, testing, and outside engineering and software services \\n Spending-Related consists primarily of depreciation and amortization of our manufacturing and engineering assets, but also includes asset retirements and operating leases \\n Advertising and Sales Promotions includes costs for advertising, marketing programs, brand promotions, customer mailings and promotional events, and auto shows \\n Administrative, Information Technology, and Selling includes primarily costs for salaried personnel and purchased services related to our staff activities, information technology, and selling functions \\n Pension and OPEB consists primarily of past service pension costs and other postretirement employee benefit costs \\n \\n Exchange primarily measures EBIT variance driven by one or more of the following: (i) transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the relevant entities, (ii) effects of converting functional currency income to U.S. dollars, (iii) effects of remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities of the relevant entities in currencies other than their functional currency, or (iv) results of our foreign currency hedging \\n \\n Other includes a variety of items, such as parts and services earnings, royalties, government incentives, and compensation-related changes \\n \\n In addition, definitions and calculations used in this report include: \\n \\n Wholesales and Revenue wholesale unit volumes include all Ford and Lincoln badged units (whether produced by Ford or by an unconsolidated affiliate) that are sold to dealerships or others, units manufactured by Ford that are sold to other manufacturers, units distributed by Ford for other manufacturers, and local brand units produced by our China joint venture, Jiangling Motors Corporation, Ltd. JMC ), that are sold to dealerships or others. Vehicles sold to daily rental car companies that are subject to a guaranteed repurchase option (i.e., rental repurchase), as well as other sales of finished vehicles for which the recognition of revenue is deferred (e.g., consignments), also are included in wholesale unit volumes. Revenue from certain vehicles in wholesale unit volumes (specifically, Ford badged vehicles produced and distributed by our unconsolidated affiliates, as well as JMC brand vehicles) are not included in our revenue \\n \\n Industry Volume and Market Share based, in part, on estimated vehicle registrations; includes medium and heavy duty trucks \\n \\n SAAR seasonally adjusted annual rate \\n 47 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Ford Next Segment \\n \\n The Ford Next segment (formerly Mobility) primarily includes expenses and investments for emerging business initiatives aimed at creating value for Ford in vehicle-adjacent market segments. \\n \\n In this segment, our 2023 EBIT loss was 138 million, a 788 million improvement from a year ago. Ford Next has evolved from primarily investing in the development of autonomous vehicle capabilities to focus exclusively on incubating and launching new businesses creating strategic value for Ford. \\n 48 \\n\\nItem 7.

Ford Credit s loss metrics continue to normalize from historic lows. Ford Credit s U.S. 36-month auction values for off-lease vehicles were down 7 from a year ago. We are planning for full year 2024 auction values to decrease as vehicle availability continues to improve. \\n \\n Ford Credit s 2023 EBT of 1,331 million was 1,326 million lower than a year ago, reflecting lower financing margin, non-recurrence of supplemental depreciation and credit loss reserve releases, lower lease residual performance, unfavorable derivative market valuation, and higher credit losses. \\n 49 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Definitions and Information Regarding Ford Credit Causal Factors \\n \\n In general, we measure year-over-year changes in Ford Credit s EBT using the causal factors listed below: \\n \\n Volume and Mix: \\n Volume primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by changes in average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses at prior period financing margin yield (defined below in financing margin) at prior period exchange rates. Volume changes are primarily driven by the volume of new and used vehicles sold and leased, the extent to which Ford Credit purchases retail financing and operating lease contracts, the extent to which Ford Credit provides wholesale financing, the sales price of the vehicles financed, the level of dealer inventories, Ford-sponsored special financing programs available exclusively through Ford Credit, and the availability of cost-effective funding \\n Mix primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by period-over-period changes in the composition of Ford Credit s average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses by product within each region \\n \\n Financing Margin: \\n Financing margin variance is the period-over-period change in financing margin yield multiplied by the present period average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses at prior period exchange rates. This calculation is performed at the product and country level and then aggregated. Financing margin yield equals revenue, less interest expense and scheduled depreciation for the period, divided by average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses for the same period \\n Financing margin changes are driven by changes in revenue and interest expense. Changes in revenue are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, cost assumptions in pricing, mix of business, and competitive environment. Changes in interest expense are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, borrowing spreads, and asset-liability management \\n \\n Credit Loss: \\n Credit loss is the change in the provision for credit losses at prior period exchange rates. For analysis purposes, management splits the provision for credit losses into net charge-offs and the change in the allowance for credit losses \\n Net charge-off changes are primarily driven by the number of repossessions, severity per repossession, and recoveries. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are primarily driven by changes in historical trends in credit losses and recoveries, changes in the composition and size of Ford Credit s present portfolio, changes in trends in historical used vehicle values, and changes in forward looking macroeconomic conditions. For additional information, refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates - Allowance for Credit Losses section of Item 7 \\n \\n Lease Residual: \\n Lease residual measures changes to residual performance at prior period exchange rates. For analysis purposes, management splits residual performance primarily into residual gains and losses, and the change in accumulated supplemental depreciation \\n Residual gain and loss changes are primarily driven by the number of vehicles returned to Ford Credit and sold, and the difference between the auction value and the depreciated value (which includes both base and accumulated supplemental depreciation) of the vehicles sold. Changes in accumulated supplemental depreciation are primarily driven by changes in Ford Credit s estimate of the expected auction value at the end of the lease term, and changes in Ford Credit s estimate of the number of vehicles that will be returned to it and sold. Depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases includes early termination losses on operating leases due to customer default events. For additional information, refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates - Accumulated Depreciation on Vehicles Subject to Operating Leases section of Item 7 \\n \\n Exchange: \\n Reflects changes in EBT driven by the effects of converting functional currency income to U.S. dollars \\n \\n Other: \\n Primarily includes operating expenses, other revenue, insurance expenses, and other income/(loss) at prior period exchange rates \\n Changes in operating expenses are primarily driven by salaried personnel costs, facilities costs, and costs associated with the origination and servicing of customer contracts \\n In general, other income/(loss) changes are primarily driven by changes in earnings related to market valuation adjustments to derivatives (primarily related to movements in interest rates) and other miscellaneous items \\n 50 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n In addition, the following definitions and calculations apply to Ford Credit when used in this Report: \\n \\n Cash (as shown in the Funding Structure and Liquidity tables) Cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash, excluding amounts related to insurance activities \\n \\n Debt (as shown in the Key Metrics and Leverage tables) Debt on Ford Credit s balance sheets. Includes debt issued in securitizations and payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets and related enhancements. Ford Credit holds the right to receive the excess cash flows not needed to pay the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions \\n \\n Earnings Before Taxes EBT Reflects Ford Credit s income before income taxes \\n \\n Loss-to-Receivables LTR Ratio LTR ratio is calculated using net charge-offs divided by average finance receivables, excluding unearned interest supplements and the allowance for credit losses \\n \\n Return on Equity ROE (as shown in the Key Metrics table) Reflects return on equity calculated by annualizing net income for the period and dividing by monthly average equity for the period \\n \\n Securitization and Restricted Cash (as shown in the Liquidity table) Securitization cash is held for the benefit of the securitization investors (for example, a reserve fund). Restricted cash primarily includes cash held to meet certain local governmental and regulatory reserve requirements and cash held under the terms of certain contractual agreements \\n \\n Securitizations (as shown in the Public Term Funding Plan table) Public securitization transactions, Rule 144A offerings sponsored by Ford Credit, and widely distributed offerings by Ford Credit Canada \\n \\n Term Asset-Backed Securities (as shown in the Funding Structure table) Obligations issued in securitization transactions that are payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets and related enhancements \\n \\n Total Net Receivables (as shown in the Key Metrics table) Includes finance receivables (retail financing and wholesale) sold for legal purposes and net investment in operating leases included in securitization transactions that do not satisfy the requirements for accounting sale treatment. These receivables and operating leases are reported on Ford Credit s balance sheets and are available only for payment of the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions; they are not available to pay the other obligations of Ford Credit or the claims of Ford Credit s other creditors \\n \\n 51 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Corporate Other \\n \\n Corporate Other primarily includes corporate governance expenses, past service pension and OPEB income and expense, interest income (excluding Ford Credit interest income and interest earned on our extended service contract portfolio) and gains and losses from our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding gains and losses on investments in equity securities), and foreign exchange derivatives gains and losses associated with intercompany lending. Corporate governance expenses are primarily administrative, delivering benefit on behalf of the global enterprise, that are not allocated to operating segments. These include expenses related to setting and directing global policy, providing oversight and stewardship, and promoting the Company s interests. For full year 2023, Corporate Other had a 760 million EBIT loss, compared with 748 million of positive EBIT in 2022. The EBIT deterioration was driven by lower past service pension and OPEB income, partially offset by higher Company excluding Ford Credit interest income, reflecting higher interest rates. \\n\\nInterest on Debt \\n \\n Interest on Debt consists of interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit. Our full year 2023 interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit was 1,302 million, 43 million higher than in 2022. \\n\\nTaxes \\n \\n Our Provision for/(Benefit from) income taxes for full year 2023 was a 362 million benefit, resulting in an effective tax rate of negative 9.1 . This includes benefits arising from U.S. research tax credits and legal entity restructuring within our leasing operations and China. \\n \\n Our full year 2023 adjusted effective tax rate, which excludes special items, was 10.0 . \\n \\n We regularly review our organizational structure and income tax elections for affiliates in non-U.S. and U.S. tax jurisdictions, which may result in changes in affiliates that are included in or excluded from our U.S. tax return. Any future changes to our structure, as well as any changes in income tax laws in the countries that we operate, could cause increases or decreases to our deferred tax balances and related valuation allowances. \\n 52 \\n\\nItem 7.

Ford Credit s loss metrics reflected healthy and stable consumer credit conditions and strong auction values. Ford Credit s U.S. 36-month auction values for off-lease vehicles were up 5 from 2021, reflecting strong demand for used vehicles, including the impact of lower new vehicle production due to the semiconductor shortage. \\n \\n Ford Credit s 2022 EBT of 2,657 million was 2,060 million lower than 2021, reflecting lower credit loss and lease residual reserve releases, lower financing margin, and lower lease return rates. \\n \\n 57 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Corporate Other \\n \\n For full year 2022, Corporate Other EBIT was 748 million, compared with EBIT of 1,247 million in 2021. The deterioration was driven by lower past service pension and OPEB income. \\n\\nInterest on Debt \\n \\n Our full year 2022 interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit was 1,259 million, 544 million lower than in 2021, primarily explained by U.S. debt restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2021 and during 2022. \\n\\nTaxes \\n \\n Our Provision for/(Benefit from) income taxes for full year 2022 was a 864 million benefit, resulting in an effective tax rate of 28.6 . This includes benefits arising from the reversal of U.S. valuation allowances, primarily as a result of planning actions. \\n \\n Our full year 2022 adjusted effective tax rate, which excludes special items, was 18.7 . \\n 58 \\n\\nItem 7.

Our key priority is to maintain a strong balance sheet to withstand potential stress scenarios, while having resources available to invest in and grow our business. At December 31, 2023, we had Company cash of 28.8 billion and liquidity of 46.4 billion. At December 31, 2023, about 90 of Company cash was held by consolidated entities domiciled in the United States. \\n \\n To be prepared for an economic downturn and other stress scenarios, we target an ongoing Company cash balance at or above 20 billion plus significant additional liquidity above our Company cash target. We expect to have periods when we will be above or below this amount due to: (i) future cash flow expectations, such as for investments in future opportunities, capital investments, debt maturities, pension contributions, or restructuring requirements, (ii) short-term timing differences, and (iii) changes in the global economic or operating environment. \\n \\n Our Company cash investments primarily include U.S. Department of Treasury obligations, federal agency securities, bank time deposits with investment-grade institutions, investment-grade corporate securities, investment-grade commercial paper, and debt obligations of a select group of non-U.S. governments, non-U.S. governmental agencies, and supranational institutions. The average maturity of these investments is approximately one year and adjusted based on market conditions and liquidity needs. We monitor our Company cash levels and average maturity on a daily basis. \\n\\n59 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Material Cash Requirements. Our material cash requirements include: \\n \\n Capital expenditures (for additional information, see the Changes in Company Cash section below) and other payments for engineering, software, product development, and implementation of our plans for electric vehicles \\n \\n Purchase of raw materials and components to support the manufacturing and sale of vehicles (including electric vehicles), parts, and accessories (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table and the accompanying description of our Purchase obligations below) \\n \\n Marketing incentive payments to dealers \\n \\n Payments for warranty and field service actions (for additional information, see Note 25 of the Notes to the Financial Statements) \\n \\n Debt repayments (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table below and Note 19 of the Notes the Financial Statements) \\n \\n Discretionary and mandatory payments to our global pension plans (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table below, the Changes in Company Cash section below, and Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements) \\n \\n Employee wages, benefits, and incentives \\n \\n Operating lease payments (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table below and Note 18 of the Notes to the Financial Statements) \\n \\n Cash effects related to the restructuring of our business \\n \\n Strategic acquisitions and investments to grow our business, including electrification \\n \\n Subject to approval by our Board of Directors, shareholder distributions in the form of dividend payments and/or a share repurchase program (including share repurchases to offset the anti-dilutive effect of increased shared-based compensation) may require the expenditure of a material amount of cash. We target shareholder distributions of 40 to 50 of adjusted free cash flow. Moreover, we may be subject to additional material cash requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, e.g., legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions, and other matters. \\n \\n We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties, and, as noted above, such commitments require a material amount of cash. Most of these are debt obligations incurred by our Ford Credit segment. In addition, as part of our normal business practices, we enter into contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components, and services to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services. These arrangements, including multi-year offtake commitments, may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase requirements. Purchase obligations in the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table below are defined as off-balance sheet agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms; however, as we purchase raw materials and components beyond the minimum amounts required by the Purchase obligations, our material cash requirements for these items are higher than what is reflected in the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table. For additional information on the timing of these payments and the impact on our working capital, see the Changes in Company Cash section below. \\n 60 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n The table below summarizes our aggregate contractual obligations as of December 31, 2023 (in millions): Payments Due by Period 2024 2025 - 2026 2027 - 2028 Thereafter Total Company excluding Ford Credit On-balance sheet Long-term debt (a) 85 4,999 1,523 12,667 19,274 Interest payments relating to long-term debt (b) 962 1,786 1,520 9,509 13,777 Finance leases (c) 67 183 144 498 892 Operating leases (d) 543 783 431 335 2,092 Pension funding (e) 195 397 402 994 Off-balance sheet Purchase obligations (f) 1,579 2,470 860 692 5,601 Total Company excluding Ford Credit 3,431 10,618 4,880 23,701 42,630 Ford Credit On-balance sheet Long-term debt (a) 30,606 53,650 18,756 9,103 112,115 Interest payments relating to long-term debt (b) 4,709 5,163 2,135 992 12,999 Operating leases 15 20 9 44 Off-balance sheet Purchase obligations 12 45 58 115 Total Ford Credit 35,342 58,878 20,958 10,095 125,273 Total Company 38,773 69,496 25,838 33,796 167,903 \\n __________ \\n (a) Excludes unamortized debt discounts/premiums, unamortized debt issuance costs, and fair value adjustments. \\n (b) Long-term debt may have fixed or variable interest rates. For long-term debt with variable-rate interest, we estimate the future interest payments based on projected market interest rates for various floating-rate benchmarks received from third parties. \\n (c) Includes interest payments of 254 million. \\n (d) Excludes approximately 449 million in future lease payments for various operating leases commencing in a future period. \\n (e) Amounts represent our estimate of contractually obligated contributions to the Ford-Werke plan. See Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for further information regarding our expected pension contributions. \\n (f) Purchase obligations under existing offtake agreements for scarce raw materials are not included in the table above. As of December 31, 2023, our estimated expenditures for the maximum quantity that we are committed to purchase under these offtake agreements through 2035, subject to certain conditions, consist of approximately 4.5 billion of purchase obligations and approximately 8 billion of contingent purchase obligations based on our present forecast. However, our forecast could fluctuate from period to period based on market prices, which could result in significant increases or decreases in our estimate. The actual price paid for these materials will be recorded on our balance sheet at the time of purchase. In addition, as market conditions dictate, we may enter into additional offtake agreements with raw material suppliers or seek to renegotiate existing agreements. For additional information, see the discussion of our offtake agreements below on page 62. \\n \\n We plan to utilize our liquidity (as described above) and our cash flows from business operations to fund our material cash requirements. \\n \\n Changes in Company Cash. In managing our business, we classify changes in Company cash into operating and non-operating items. Operating items include: Company adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit EBT, capital spending, depreciation and tooling amortization, changes in working capital, Ford Credit distributions, interest on debt, cash taxes, and all other and timing differences (including timing differences between accrual-based EBIT and associated cash flows). Non-operating items include: restructuring costs, changes in Company debt excluding Ford Credit, contributions to funded pension plans, shareholder distributions, and other items (including gains and losses on investments in equity securities, acquisitions and divestitures, equity investments, and other transactions with Ford Credit). \\n\\n61 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n With respect to Changes in working capital, in general, the Company excluding Ford Credit carries relatively low trade receivables compared with our trade payables because the majority of our wholesales are financed (primarily by Ford Credit) immediately upon the sale of vehicles to dealers, which generally occurs shortly after being produced. In contrast, our trade payables are based primarily on industry-standard production supplier payment terms of about 45 days. As a result, our cash flow deteriorates if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) decrease while trade payables continue to become due. Conversely, our cash flow improves if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) increase while new trade payables are generally not due for about 45 days. For example, the suspension of production at most of our assembly plants and lower industry volumes due to COVID-19 in early 2020 resulted in an initial deterioration of our cash flow, while the subsequent resumption of manufacturing operations and return to pre-COVID-19 production levels at most of our assembly plants resulted in a subsequent improvement of our cash flow. Even in normal economic conditions, however, these working capital balances generally are subject to seasonal changes that can impact cash flow. For example, we typically experience cash flow timing differences associated with inventories and payables due to our annual shutdown periods when production, and therefore inventories and wholesale volumes, are usually at their lowest levels, while payables continue to come due and be paid. The net impact of this typically results in cash outflows from changes in our working capital balances during these shutdown periods. \\n \\n Our finished product inventory at December 31, 2023 was higher than at December 31, 2022, primarily reflecting higher in-transit inventory. \\n \\n In response to, or in anticipation of, supplier disruptions, we may stockpile certain components or raw materials to help prevent disruption in our production of vehicles. Such actions could have a short-term adverse impact on our cash and increase our inventory. Moreover, in order to secure critical materials for production of electric vehicles, we have entered into and we may, in the future, enter into offtake agreements with raw material suppliers and make investments in certain raw material and battery suppliers, including contributing up to a maximum of 6.6 billion in capital to BlueOval SK, LLC over a five-year period ending in 2026. Our actual capital outlay could vary significantly based on the final project costs and potential financing opportunities. Such investments could have an additional adverse impact on our cash in the near-term. \\n \\n The terms of the offtake agreements we have entered into, and those we may enter into in the future, vary by transaction, though they generally obligate us to purchase a certain percentage or minimum amount of output produced by the counterparty over an agreed upon period of time. The purchase price mechanism included in the offtake agreement is typically based on the market price of the material at the time of delivery. The terms also may include conditions to our obligation to purchase the materials, such as quality or minimum output. Subject to satisfaction of those conditions, we will be obligated to purchase the materials at the cost determined by the purchase price mechanism. Based on the offtake agreements we have entered into thus far, the earliest date by which we could be obligated to purchase any output, subject to satisfaction of the applicable conditions, will be in 2024. \\n \\n Unlike our historical arrangements with suppliers, under multi-year offtake agreements, the risks associated with lower-than-expected electric vehicle production volumes or changes in battery technology that reduce the need for certain raw materials are borne by Ford rather than our suppliers. Accordingly, in the event we do not purchase the materials pursuant to the terms of these agreements and we are unable to restructure an agreement or an alternate purchaser is unable to be found, Ford retains its obligation for the cost of those materials. For additional discussion of the risks related to our offtake agreements and other long-term purchase contracts, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. \\n \\n Financial institutions participate in a supply chain finance SCF program that enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their Ford receivables (i.e., our payment obligations to the suppliers) to the financial institutions on a non-recourse basis in order to be paid earlier than our payment terms provide. Our suppliers voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms, the amounts we pay, or our liquidity. We have no economic interest in a supplier s decision to participate in the SCF program, and we do not provide any guarantees in connection with it. As of December 31, 2023, the outstanding amount of Ford receivables that suppliers elected to sell to the SCF financial institutions was 220 million. The amount settled through the SCF program during 2023 was 1.8 billion. \\n \\n 62 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Changes in Company cash excluding Ford Credit are summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2021 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2023 Company Excluding Ford Credit Company Adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit (a) 5.3 7.8 9.1 Capital spending (6.2) (6.5) (8.2) Depreciation and tooling amortization 5.1 5.2 5.3 Net spending (1.1) (1.3) (2.9) Receivables (0.2) (1.0) (1.0) Inventory (1.8) (2.5) (1.2) Trade Payables 0.3 3.7 (0.2) Changes in working capital (1.7) 0.2 (2.4) Ford Credit distributions 7.5 2.1 Interest on debt and cash taxes (2.3) (1.7) (2.2) All other and timing differences (3.1) 1.9 5.2 Company adjusted free cash flow (a) 4.6 9.1 6.8 Restructuring (1.9) (0.4) (0.9) Changes in debt (3.7) (0.4) (0.2) Funded pension contributions (0.8) (0.6) (0.6) Shareholder distributions (0.4) (2.5) (5.3) All other (b) 7.9 (9.5) (3.2) Change in cash 5.7 (4.3) (3.4) \\n __________ \\n (a) See Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations section for reconciliation to GAAP. \\n (b) 2021 includes our investment in Rivian of 10.6 billion and cash premium paid of (1.6) billion associated with repurchasing and redeeming 7.6 billion of higher-coupon debt. 2022 includes a 7.4 billion loss on our Rivian investment. 2023 includes 2.6 billion of capital contributions to BlueOval SK, LLC. \\n Note: Numbers may not sum due to rounding. \\n \\n Our full year 2023 Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities was positive 14.9 billion, an increase of 8.1 billion from a year ago (see page 78 for additional information). The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher net income. \\n \\n Company adjusted free cash flow was 6.8 billion, 2.3 billion lower than a year ago. An improvement in Company adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit and timing differences were more than offset by the non-repeat of working capital improvements and Ford Credit distributions, as well as higher capital spending. \\n \\n Capital spending was 8.2 billion in 2023, 1.6 billion higher than a year ago, and is expected to be in the range of 8 billion to 9.5 billion in 2024. \\n \\n The full year 2023 working capital impact was 2.4 billion negative, driven by an increase in inventory and receivables. All other and timing differences were positive 5.2 billion. Timing differences include differences between accrual-based EBIT and the associated cash flows (e.g., marketing incentive and warranty payments to dealers, JV equity income, compensation payments, and pension and OPEB income or expense). \\n \\n Shareholder distributions (including cash dividends and anti-dilutive share repurchases) were 5.3 billion in 2023. On February 6, 2024, we declared a regular dividend of 0.15 per share and a supplemental dividend of 0.18 per share. \\n 63 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Available Credit Lines . Total Company committed credit lines, excluding Ford Credit, at December 31, 2023 were 19.4 billion, consisting of 13.5 billion of our corporate credit facility, 2.0 billion of our supplemental revolving credit facility, 1.8 billion of our 364-day revolving credit facility, and 2.2 billion of local credit facilities. At December 31, 2023, the utilized portion of the corporate credit facility was 18 million, representing amounts utilized for letters of credit. In addition, 1.8 billion of committed Company credit lines, excluding Ford Credit, was utilized under local credit facilities for our affiliates as of December 31, 2023. \\n \\n Lenders under our corporate credit facility have 3.4 billion of commitments maturing on April 26, 2026 and 10.1 billion of commitments maturing on April 26, 2028. Lenders under our supplemental revolving credit facility have 0.1 billion of commitments maturing on September 29, 2024 and 1.9 billion of commitments maturing on April 26, 2026. Lenders under our 364-day revolving credit facility have 1.8 billion of commitments maturing on April 24, 2024. \\n \\n On August 17, 2023, we entered into a new 364-day revolving credit facility, with 4 billion of commitments maturing on August 15, 2024. At the time we entered into this credit facility, it provided additional working capital flexibility to manage through uncertainties in the present environment, including a potential labor disruption. With the ratification of the new UAW contract, this credit facility was terminated as of November 24, 2023. \\n \\n The corporate, supplemental, and 364-day credit agreements include certain sustainability-linked targets, pursuant to which the applicable margin and facility fees may be adjusted if Ford achieves, or fails to achieve, the specified targets related to global manufacturing facility greenhouse gas emissions, renewable electricity consumption, and Ford Europe CO 2 tailpipe emissions. Ford outperformed the 2022 targets for all three of the sustainability-linked metrics, which favorably impacted pricing beginning in the third quarter of 2023 . \\n \\n The corporate credit facility is unsecured and free of material adverse change conditions to borrowing, restrictive financial covenants (for example, interest or fixed-charge coverage ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and minimum net worth requirements), and credit rating triggers that could limit our ability to obtain funding or trigger early repayment. The corporate credit facility contains a liquidity covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum of 4 billion in aggregate of domestic cash, cash equivalents, and loaned and marketable securities and/or availability under the corporate credit facility, supplemental revolving credit facility, and 364-day revolving credit facility. The terms and conditions of the supplemental and 364-day revolving credit facilities are consistent with our corporate credit facility. Ford Credit has been designated as a subsidiary borrower under the corporate credit facility and the 364-day revolving credit facility. \\n \\n Each of the corporate credit facility, supplemental revolving credit facility, and 364-day revolving credit facility include a covenant that requires us to provide guarantees from certain of our subsidiaries in the event that our senior, unsecured, long-term debt does not maintain at least two investment grade ratings from Fitch, Moody s, and S P. On October 30, 2023, following the upgrade by S P of our senior, unsecured, long-term debt credit rating to BBB-, the unsecured guarantees provided by the following subsidiaries to the lenders under the credit facilities were released: Ford Component Sales, LLC; Ford European Holdings Inc.; Ford Global Technologies, LLC; Ford Holdings LLC (the parent company of Ford Credit); Ford International Capital LLC; Ford Mexico Holdings LLC; Ford Motor Service Company; Ford Next LLC; Ford Trading Company, LLC; and Ford Van Dyke Investment Fund, Inc. \\n \\n Debt. As shown in Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, at December 31, 2023, Company debt excluding Ford Credit was 19.9 billion, unchanged from December 31, 2022. \\n \\n Leverage. We manage Company debt (excluding Ford Credit) levels with a leverage framework that targets investment grade credit ratings through a normal business cycle. The leverage framework includes a ratio of total Company debt (excluding Ford Credit), underfunded pension liabilities, operating leases, and other adjustments, divided by Company adjusted EBIT (excluding Ford Credit EBT), and further adjusted to exclude depreciation and tooling amortization (excluding Ford Credit). \\n \\n Ford Credit s leverage is calculated as a separate business as described in the Liquidity - Ford Credit Segment section of Item 7. Ford Credit is self-funding and its debt, which is used to fund its operations, is separate from our Company debt excluding Ford Credit. \\n \\n 64 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Ford Credit Segment \\n \\n Ford Credit remains well capitalized with a strong balance sheet and funding diversified across platforms and markets. Ford Credit continues to have robust access to the capital markets, and ended 2023 with 25.7 billion of liquidity, up 4.6 billion from 2022. \\n \\n Key elements of Ford Credit s funding strategy include: \\n \\n Maintain strong liquidity and funding diversity \\n Prudently access public markets \\n Continue to leverage retail deposit funding in Europe \\n Flexibility to increase ABS mix as needed; preserving assets and committed capacity \\n Target financial statement leverage of 9:1 to 10:1 \\n Maintain self-liquidating balance sheet \\n \\n Ford Credit s liquidity profile continues to be diverse, robust, and focused on maintaining liquidity levels that meet its business and funding requirements. Ford Credit regularly stress tests its balance sheet and liquidity to ensure that it can continue to meet its financial obligations through economic cycles. \\n \\n Funding Sources. Ford Credit s funding sources include primarily unsecured debt and securitization transactions (including other structured financings). Ford Credit issues both short-term and long-term debt that is held by both institutional and retail investors, with long-term debt having an original maturity of more than 12 months. Ford Credit sponsors a number of securitization programs that can be structured to provide both short-term and long-term funding through institutional investors and other financial institutions in the United States and international capital markets. \\n \\n Ford Credit obtains unsecured funding from the sale of demand notes under its Ford Interest Advantage program and through the retail deposit programs at FCE Bank plc FCE and Ford Bank GmbH Ford Bank ). At December 31, 2023, the principal amount outstanding of Ford Interest Advantage notes, which may be redeemed at any time at the option of the holders thereof without restriction, and FCE and Ford Bank deposits was 17.2 billion. Ford Credit maintains multiple sources of readily available liquidity to fund the payment of its unsecured short-term debt obligations. \\n \\n The following table shows funding for Ford Credit s net receivables (in billions): December 31, 2021 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2023 Funding Structure Term unsecured debt 59.4 48.3 54.1 Term asset-backed securities 45.4 56.4 58.0 Retail Deposits / Ford Interest Advantage 12.9 14.3 17.2 Other (0.1) 2.7 1.4 Equity 12.4 11.9 13.4 Adjustments for cash (12.5) (11.3) (10.9) Total Net Receivables 117.5 122.3 133.2 Securitized Funding as Percent of Total Debt 38.5 47.4 44.9 \\n \\n Net receivables of 133.2 billion at December 31, 2023 were funded primarily with term unsecured debt and term asset-backed securities.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Public Term Funding Plan. The following table shows Ford Credit s issuances for full year 2021, 2022, and 2023, and its planned issuances for full year 2024, excluding short-term funding programs (in billions): \\n 2021 \\n Actual \\n 2022 \\n Actual \\n 2023 \\n Actual \\n 2024 \\n Forecast \\n Unsecured 5 6 14 14 - 17 Securitizations 9 10 14 13 - 16 Total public 14 16 28 27 - 33 \\n \\n In 2023, Ford Credit completed 28 billion of public term funding. For 2024, Ford Credit projects full year public term funding in the range of 27 billion to 33 billion. Through February 5, 2024, we completed 5 billion of public term issuances. \\n \\n Liquidity. The following table shows Ford Credit s liquidity sources and utilization (in billions): \\n December 31, 2021 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2023 Liquidity Sources (a) \\n Cash 12.5 11.3 10.9 Committed asset-backed facilities 37.1 37.4 42.9 Other unsecured credit facilities 2.7 2.3 2.4 Total liquidity sources 52.3 51.0 56.2 Utilization of Liquidity (a) \\n Securitization cash and restricted cash (3.9) (2.9) (2.8) Committed asset-backed facilities (12.5) (26.6) (27.5) Other unsecured credit facilities (1.0) (0.8) (0.4) Total utilization of liquidity (17.4) (30.3) (30.7) Gross liquidity 34.9 20.7 25.5 Asset-backed capacity in excess of eligible receivables and other adjustments (2.8) 0.4 0.2 Net liquidity available for use 32.1 21.1 25.7 \\n __________ \\n (a) See Definitions and Information Regarding Ford Credit Causal Factors section. \\n \\n Ford Credit s net liquidity available for use will fluctuate quarterly based on factors including near-term debt maturities, receivable growth and decline, and timing of funding transactions. At December 31, 2023, Ford Credit s net liquidity available for use was 25.7 billion, 4.6 billion higher than year-end 2022, reflecting strong access to public funding markets and the addition of 5.5 billion in committed asset-backed capacity. Ford Credit s sources of liquidity include cash, committed asset-backed facilities, and unsecured credit facilities. At December 31, 2023, Ford Credit s liquidity sources, including cash, committed asset-backed facilities, and unsecured credit facilities, totaled 56.2 billion, up 5.2 billion from year-end 2022. \\n \\n Material Cash Requirements. Ford Credit s material cash requirements include: (1) the purchase of retail financing and operating lease contracts from dealers and providing wholesale financing for dealers to finance new and used vehicles; and (2) debt repayments (for additional information on debt, see the Balance Sheet Liquidity Profile section below, the Material Cash Requirements section in Liquidity and Capital Resources - Company excluding Ford Credit above, and Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements). In addition, subject to approval by Ford Credit s Board of Directors, shareholder distributions may require the expenditure of a material amount of cash. Moreover, Ford Credit may be subject to additional material cash requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, e.g., legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions, and other matters. \\n \\n Ford Credit plans to utilize its liquidity (as described above) and its cash flows from business operations to fund its material cash requirements. \\n \\n 66 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Balance Sheet Liquidity Profile. Ford Credit defines its balance sheet liquidity profile as the cumulative maturities, including the impact of expected prepayments and allowance for credit losses, of its finance receivables, investment in operating leases, and cash, less the cumulative debt maturities over upcoming annual periods. Ford Credit s balance sheet is inherently liquid because of the short-term nature of its finance receivables, investment in operating leases, and cash. Ford Credit ensures its cumulative debt maturities have a longer tenor than its cumulative asset maturities. This positive maturity profile is intended to provide Ford Credit with additional liquidity after all of its assets have been funded and is in addition to liquidity available to protect for stress scenarios. \\n \\n The following table shows Ford Credit s cumulative maturities for assets and total debt for the periods presented and unsecured long-term debt maturities in the individual periods presented (in billions): \\n 2024 2025 2026 2027 and Beyond \\n Balance Sheet Liquidity Profile Assets (a) 76 104 126 149 Total debt (b) 61 88 105 131 Memo: Unsecured long-term debt maturities 12 13 11 21 \\n __________ \\n (a) Includes gross finance receivables less the allowance for credit losses (including certain finance receivables that are reclassified in consolidation to Trade and other receivables ), investment in operating leases net of accumulated depreciation, cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding amounts related to insurance activities). Amounts shown include the impact of expected prepayments. \\n (b) Excludes unamortized debt (discount)/premium, unamortized issuance costs, and fair value adjustments. \\n \\n Maturities of investment in operating leases consist primarily of the portion of rental payments attributable to depreciation over the remaining life of the lease and the expected residual value at lease termination. Maturities of finance receivables and investment in operating leases in the table above include expected prepayments for Ford Credit s retail installment sale contracts and investment in operating leases. The table above also reflects adjustments to debt maturities to match the asset-backed debt maturities with the underlying asset maturities. \\n \\n All wholesale securitization transactions and wholesale receivables are shown maturing in the next 12 months, even if the maturities extend beyond 2024. The retail securitization transactions under certain committed asset-backed facilities are assumed to amortize immediately rather than amortizing after the expiration of the commitment period. As of December 31, 2023, Ford Credit had 149 billion of assets, 68 billion of which were unencumbered. \\n \\n Funding and Liquidity Risks. Ford Credit s funding plan is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control, including disruption in the capital markets that could impact both unsecured debt and asset-backed securities issuance and the effects of regulatory changes on the financial markets. \\n \\n Despite Ford Credit s diverse sources of funding and liquidity, its ability to maintain liquidity may be affected by, among others, the following factors (not necessarily listed in order of importance or probability of occurrence): \\n \\n Prolonged disruption of the debt and securitization markets; \\n Global capital markets volatility; \\n Credit ratings assigned to Ford and Ford Credit; \\n Market capacity for Ford- and Ford Credit-sponsored investments; \\n General demand for the type of securities Ford Credit offers; \\n Ford Credit s ability to continue funding through asset-backed financing structures; \\n Performance of the underlying assets within Ford Credit s asset-backed financing structures; \\n Inability to obtain hedging instruments; \\n Accounting and regulatory changes; and \\n Ford Credit s ability to maintain credit facilities and committed asset-backed facilities. \\n \\n Stress Tests. Ford Credit regularly conducts stress testing on its funding and liquidity sources to ensure it can continue to meet financial obligations and support the sale of Ford and Lincoln vehicles during firm-specific and market-wide stress events. Stress tests are intended to quantify the potential impact of various adverse scenarios on the balance sheet and liquidity. These scenarios include assumptions on access to unsecured and secured debt markets, runoff of short-term funding, and ability to renew expiring liquidity commitments and are measured over various time periods, including 30 days, 90 days, and longer term. Ford Credit s stress test does not assume any additional funding, liquidity, or capital support from Ford. Ford Credit routinely develops contingency funding plans as part of its liquidity stress testing. \\n 67 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Leverage. Ford Credit uses leverage, or the debt-to-equity ratio, to make various business decisions, including evaluating and establishing pricing for finance receivable and operating lease financing, and assessing its capital structure. \\n \\n The table below shows the calculation of Ford Credit s financial statement leverage (in billions): December 31, 2021 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2023 Leverage Calculation Debt 117.7 119.0 129.3 Equity (a) 12.4 11.9 13.4 Financial statement leverage (to 1) 9.5 10.0 9.7 \\n __________ \\n (a) Total shareholder s interest reported on Ford Credit s balance sheets. \\n \\n Ford Credit plans its leverage by considering market conditions and the risk characteristics of its business. At December 31, 2023, Ford Credit s financial statement leverage was 9.7:1. Ford Credit targets financial statement leverage in the range of 9:1 to 10:1. \\n 68 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Total Company \\n \\n Pension Plan Contributions and Strategy. Our strategy is to reduce the risk of our funded defined benefit pension plans, including minimizing the volatility of the value of our pension assets relative to pension liabilities and the need for unplanned use of capital resources to fund the plans. The strategy reduces balance sheet, cash flow, and income exposures and, in turn, reduces our risk profile. Going forward, we expect to: \\n \\n Limit our pension contributions to offset ongoing service cost, ensure our funded plans remain fully funded in aggregate, and meet regulatory requirements, if any; \\n Minimize the volatility of the value of our pension assets relative to pension obligations and ensure assets are sufficient to pay plan benefits; and \\n Evaluate strategic actions to reduce pension liabilities, such as plan design changes, curtailments, or settlements \\n 2022 2023 2023 \\n H / (L) \\n 2022 \\n Pension Funded Status B) \\n U.S. Plans 0.1 (1.3) (1.4) Non-U.S. Plans (0.3) (1.0) (0.7) Total Global Pension (0.2) (2.3) (2.1) Year-End Discount Rate (Weighted Average) \\n U.S. Plans 5.51 5.17 (34) bps Non-U.S. Plans 4.42 3.98 (44) bps Actual Asset Returns U.S. Plans (21.20) 7.41 28.61 ppts Non-U.S. Plans (25.40) 5.56 30.96 ppts Pension - Funded Plans Only B) \\n Funded Status 4.1 2.1 (2.0) Contributions for Funded Plans 0.6 0.6 \\n \\n Worldwide, our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by 2.3 billion at December 31, 2023, a deterioration of 2.1 billion from December 31, 2022, primarily reflecting the impact of lower discount rates compared to year-end 2022 and pension benefit enhancements as part of the collective bargaining agreements in the United States and Canada, partially offset by asset gains in excess of our assumptions. Of the 2.3 billion underfunded status at year-end 2023, our funded plans were 2.1 billion overfunded and our unfunded plans were 4.4 billion underfunded. These unfunded plans are pay as you go with benefits paid from Company cash and primarily include certain plans in Germany and U.S. defined benefit plans for senior management. \\n \\n The fixed income mix was 76 in our U.S. plans and 78 in our non-U.S. plans at year-end 2023. \\n \\n In 2023, we contributed 592 million to our global funded pension plans, an increase of 25 million compared with 2022. During 2024, we expect to contribute about 1 billion of cash to our global funded pension plans. We also expect to make about 400 million of benefit payments to participants in unfunded plans. Based on current assumptions and regulations, we do not expect to have a legal requirement to fund our major U.S. plans in 2024. Our global funded plans remain fully funded in aggregate, demonstrating the effectiveness of our de-risking strategy and our commitment to a strong balance sheet. \\n \\n For a detailed discussion of our pension plans, refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates - Pensions and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2023 Form 10-K Report and Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. \\n 69 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Return on Invested Capital ROIC ). We analyze total Company performance using an adjusted ROIC financial metric based on an after-tax rolling four quarter average.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n CREDIT RATINGS \\n \\n Our short-term and long-term debt is rated by four credit rating agencies designated as nationally recognized statistical rating organizations NRSROs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission: DBRS, Fitch, Moody s, and S P. \\n \\n In several markets, locally recognized rating agencies also rate us. A credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the credit risk associated with a corporate entity or particular securities issued by that entity. Rating agencies ratings of us are based on information provided by us and other sources. Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria for evaluating company risk and, therefore, ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. \\n \\n The following rating actions were taken by these NRSROs since the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023: \\n \\n On October 30, 2023, S P upgraded the credit ratings for Ford and Ford Credit to BBB- from BB+ and revised the outlook to stable from positive. \\n \\n The following table summarizes certain of the credit ratings and outlook presently assigned by these four NRSROs: NRSRO RATINGS Ford Ford Credit NRSROs Issuer Default / Corporate / Issuer Rating Long-Term Senior Unsecured Outlook / Trend Long-Term Senior Unsecured Short-Term Unsecured Outlook / Trend Minimum Long-Term Investment Grade Rating DBRS BBB (low) BBB (low) Stable BBB (low) R-2 (low) Stable BBB (low) Fitch BBB- BBB- Stable BBB- F3 Stable BBB- Moody s N/A Ba1 Stable Ba1 NP Stable Baa3 S P BBB- BBB- Stable BBB- A-3 Stable BBB- \\n \\n 71 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n OUTLOOK \\n \\n We provided 2024 Company guidance in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K dated February 6, 2024. The guidance is based on our expectations as of February 6, 2024, and assumes no material change to our current assumptions for inflation, logistics issues, production, or macroeconomic conditions. Our actual results could differ materially from our guidance due to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including those set forth in Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I. 2024 Guidance Total Company Adjusted EBIT (a) 10 - 12 billion Adjusted Free Cash Flow (a) 6 - 7 billion Capital spending 8 - 9.5 billion Ford Credit EBT About 1.5 billion \\n __________ \\n (a) When we provide guidance for Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted Free Cash Flow, we do not provide guidance for the most comparable GAAP measures because, as described in more detail below in Non-GAAP Measures That Supplement GAAP Measures, they include items that are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty. \\n\\nFor full-year 2024, we expect adjusted EBIT of 10 billion to 12 billion and adjusted free cash flow of 6 billion to 7 billion. \\n \\n On a segment basis, we expect: \\n \\n Ford Pro EBIT of 8 billion to 9 billion driven by continued growth and favorable mix, partially offset by moderated pricing \\n Ford Blue EBIT of 7 billion to 7.5 billion, reflecting a balanced market equation, including the impact of our all-new F-150 launch; we also expect costs to be flat as we offset higher labor and product cost with efficiencies \\n Ford Model e EBIT loss of 5 billion to 5.5 billion, primarily driven by continued pricing pressure and investments in next generation vehicles \\n Ford Credit EBT of about 1.5 billion \\n \\n Our outlook for 2024 assumes: \\n \\n Flat to modest U.S. industry growth at 16 million to 16.5 million \\n Non-recurrence of the UAW strike \\n Full year of all-new Super Duty, which drives positive pricing and mix in Ford Pro \\n Lower industry pricing as supply and demand normalize \\n 2 billion benefit from cost reduction initiatives, offsetting higher labor and major product refresh actions \\n\\n72 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements \\n \\n Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations, forecasts, and assumptions by our management and involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: \\n \\n Ford is highly dependent on its suppliers to deliver components in accordance with Ford s production schedule and specifications, and a shortage of or inability to acquire key components or raw materials, such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, can disrupt Ford s production of vehicles; \\n To facilitate access to the raw materials and other components necessary for the production of electric vehicles, Ford has entered into and may, in the future, enter into multi-year commitments to raw material and other suppliers that subject Ford to risks associated with lower future demand for such items as well as costs that fluctuate and are difficult to accurately forecast; \\n Ford s long-term competitiveness depends on the successful execution of Ford+; \\n Ford s vehicles could be affected by defects that result in recall campaigns, increased warranty costs, or delays in new model launches, and the time it takes to improve the quality of our vehicles and services could continue to have an adverse effect on our business; \\n Ford may not realize the anticipated benefits of existing or pending strategic alliances, joint ventures, acquisitions, divestitures, or business strategies; \\n Ford may not realize the anticipated benefits of restructuring actions and such actions may cause Ford to incur significant charges, disrupt our operations, or harm our reputation; \\n Operational information systems, security systems, vehicles, and services could be affected by cybersecurity incidents, ransomware attacks, and other disruptions and impact Ford and Ford Credit as well as their suppliers and dealers; \\n Ford s production, as well as Ford s suppliers production, and/or the ability to deliver products to consumers could be disrupted by labor issues, public health issues, natural or man-made disasters, adverse effects of climate change, financial distress, production difficulties, capacity limitations, or other factors; \\n Failure to develop and deploy secure digital services that appeal to customers could have a negative impact on Ford s business; \\n Ford s ability to maintain a competitive cost structure could be affected by labor or other constraints; \\n Ford s ability to attract, develop, grow, and reward talent is critical to its success and competitiveness; \\n Ford s new and existing products and digital, software, and physical services are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries, and its reputation may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced; \\n Ford s results are dependent on sales of larger, more profitable vehicles, particularly in the United States; \\n With a global footprint and supply chain, Ford s results and operations could be adversely affected by economic or geopolitical developments, including protectionist trade policies such as tariffs, or other events; \\n Industry sales volume can be volatile and could decline if there is a financial crisis, recession, public health emergency, or significant geopolitical event; \\n Ford may face increased price competition or a reduction in demand for its products resulting from industry excess capacity, currency fluctuations, competitive actions, or other factors, particularly for electric vehicles; \\n Inflationary pressure and fluctuations in commodity and energy prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and market value of Ford or Ford Credit s investments, including marketable securities, can have a significant effect on results; \\n Ford and Ford Credit s access to debt, securitization, or derivative markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts could be affected by credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, regulatory requirements, or other factors; \\n The impact of government incentives on Ford s business could be significant, and Ford s receipt of government incentives could be subject to reduction, termination, or clawback; \\n Ford Credit could experience higher-than-expected credit losses, lower-than-anticipated residual values, or higher-than-expected return volumes for leased vehicles; \\n Economic and demographic experience for pension and OPEB plans (e.g., discount rates or investment returns) could be worse than Ford has assumed; \\n Pension and other postretirement liabilities could adversely affect Ford s liquidity and financial condition; \\n Ford and Ford Credit could experience unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations, or adverse publicity arising out of alleged defects in products, services, perceived environmental impacts, or otherwise; \\n Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations; \\n Ford and Ford Credit could be affected by the continued development of more stringent privacy, data use, data protection, and artificial intelligence laws and regulations as well as consumers heightened expectations to safeguard their personal information; and \\n Ford Credit could be subject to new or increased credit regulations, consumer protection regulations, or other regulations. \\n 73 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n We cannot be certain that any expectation, forecast, or assumption made in preparing forward-looking statements will prove accurate, or that any projection will be realized. It is to be expected that there may be differences between projected and actual results. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of their initial issuance, and we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. For additional discussion, see Item 1A. Risk Factors above. \\n 74 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT SUPPLEMENT GAAP MEASURES \\n \\n We use both generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for operational and financial decision making, and to assess Company and segment business performance. The non-GAAP measures listed below are intended to be considered by users as supplemental information to their equivalent GAAP measures, to aid investors in better understanding our financial results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful perspective on underlying operating results and trends, and a means to compare our period-over-period results. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in items or events being adjusted. \\n \\n Company Adjusted EBIT (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Income/(Loss) Attributable to Ford) Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) excludes interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), taxes, and pre-tax special items. This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it focuses on underlying operating results and trends, and improves comparability of our period-over-period results. Our management ordinarily excludes special items from its review of the results of the operating segments for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources. Our categories of pre-tax special items and the applicable significance guideline for each item (which may consist of a group of items related to a single event or action) are as follows: \\n \\n Pre-Tax Special Item Significance Guideline Pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses No minimum Gains and losses on investments in equity securities No minimum Personnel expenses, supplier- and dealer-related costs, and facility-related charges stemming from our efforts to match production capacity and cost structure to market demand and changing model mix Generally 100 million or more Other items that we do not necessarily consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities 500 million or more for individual field service actions; generally 100 million or more for other items \\n \\n When we provide guidance for adjusted EBIT, we do not provide guidance on a net income basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty, including gains and losses on pension and OPEB remeasurements and on investments in equity securities. \\n \\n Company Adjusted EBIT Margin (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Company Net Income/(Loss) Margin) Company Adjusted EBIT margin is Company adjusted EBIT divided by Company revenue. This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it allows users to evaluate our operating results aligned with industry reporting. \\n \\n Adjusted Earnings/(Loss) Per Share (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Earnings/(Loss) Per Share) Measure of Company s diluted net earnings/(loss) per share adjusted for impact of pre-tax special items (described above), tax special items, and restructuring impacts in noncontrolling interests. The measure provides investors with useful information to evaluate performance of our business excluding items not indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities. When we provide guidance for adjusted earnings/(loss) per share, we do not provide guidance on an earnings/(loss) per share basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses. \\n \\n Adjusted Effective Tax Rate (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Effective Tax Rate) Measure of Company s tax rate excluding pre-tax special items (described above) and tax special items. The measure provides an ongoing effective rate which investors find useful for historical comparisons and for forecasting. When we provide guidance for adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide guidance on an effective tax rate basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses. \\n 75 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Company Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Cash Provided By/(Used In) Operating Activities) Measure of Company s operating cash flow excluding Ford Credit s operating cash flows. The measure contains elements management considers operating activities, including Company excluding Ford Credit capital spending, Ford Credit distributions to its parent, and settlement of derivatives. The measure excludes cash outflows for funded pension contributions, restructuring actions, and other items that are considered operating cash flows under U.S. GAAP. This measure is useful to management and investors because it is consistent with management s assessment of the Company s operating cash flow performance. When we provide guidance for Company adjusted free cash flow, we do not provide guidance for net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities because the GAAP measure will include items that are difficult to quantify or predict with reasonable certainty, including cash flows related to the Company's exposures to foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices (separate from any related hedges), Ford Credit's operating cash flows, and cash flows related to special items, including separation payments, each of which individually or in the aggregate could have a significant impact to our net cash provided by/(used in) our operating activities. \\n \\n Adjusted ROIC Calculated as the sum of adjusted net operating profit/(loss) after cash tax from the last four quarters, divided by the average invested capital over the last four quarters. Adjusted Return on Invested Capital Adjusted ROIC provides management and investors with useful information to evaluate the Company s after-cash tax operating return on its invested capital for the period presented.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \\n\\nWe consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. \\n \\n Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. \\n \\n Warranties and Field Service Actions \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required. We provide base warranties on the products we sell for specific periods of time and/or mileage, which vary depending upon the type of product and the geographic location of its sale. Separately, we also periodically perform field service actions related to safety recalls, emission recalls, and other product campaigns. Pursuant to these warranties and field service actions, we will repair, replace, or adjust parts on a vehicle that are defective in factory-supplied materials or workmanship. We accrue the estimated cost of both base warranty coverages and field service actions at the time of sale. In addition, from time to time, we issue extended warranties at our expense, the estimated cost of which is accrued at the time of issuance. \\n \\n Assumptions and Approach Used. We establish our estimate of base warranty obligations using a patterned estimation model. We use historical information regarding the nature, frequency, and average cost of claims for each vehicle line by model year. We reevaluate our estimate of base warranty obligations on a regular basis. Experience has shown that initial data for any given model year may be volatile; therefore, our process relies on long-term historical averages until sufficient data are available. With actual experience, we use the data to update the historical averages. We then compare the resulting accruals with present spending rates to assess whether the balances are adequate to meet expected future obligations. Based on this data, we update our estimates as necessary. \\n \\n Field service actions may occur in periods beyond the base warranty coverage period. We establish our estimates of field service action obligations using a patterned estimation model. We use historical information regarding the nature, frequency, severity, and average cost of claims for each model year. We assess our obligation for field service actions on a regular basis using actual claims experience and update our estimates as necessary. \\n \\n Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors used in establishing our estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 25 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for information regarding warranty and field service action costs. \\n \\n Pensions and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required. The estimation of our defined benefit pension and OPEB plan obligations and expenses requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events, such as demographic experience and health care cost increases. Plan obligations and expenses are based on existing retirement plan provisions. No assumption is made regarding any potential future changes to benefit provisions beyond those to which we are presently committed (e.g., in existing labor contracts). \\n 83 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Assumptions and Approach Used. The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: \\n \\n Discount rates. Our discount rate assumptions are based primarily on the results of cash flow matching analyses, which match the future cash outflows for each major plan to a yield curve based on high-quality bonds specific to the country of the plan. Benefit payments are discounted at the rates on the curve to determine the year-end obligations. \\n \\n Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Our expected long-term rate of return considers inputs from a range of advisors for capital market returns, adjusted for specific aspects of our investment strategy by plan. Historical returns also are considered when appropriate. The assumption is based on consideration of all inputs, with a focus on long-term trends to avoid short-term market influences. \\n \\n Salary growth. Our salary growth assumption reflects our actual experience, long-term outlook, and assumed inflation. \\n \\n Inflation. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators, including real gross domestic product growth and central bank inflation targets. \\n \\n Expected contributions. Our expected amount and timing of contributions are based on an assessment of minimum requirements, cash availability, and other considerations (e.g., funded status, avoidance of regulatory premiums and levies, and tax efficiency). \\n \\n Retirement rates. Retirement rates are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience. \\n \\n Mortality rates. Mortality rates are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience. \\n \\n Health care cost trends . Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook, and an assessment of likely long-term trends. \\n \\n Assumptions are set at each year-end and are generally not changed during the year unless there is a major plan event, such as a curtailment or settlement that would trigger a plan remeasurement. \\n \\n See Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding pension and OPEB costs and assumptions. \\n \\n Pension Plans \\n \\n Effect of Actual Results . The year-end 2023 weighted average discount rate was 5.17 for U.S. plans and 3.98 for non-U.S. plans, reflecting decreases of 34 and 44 basis points, respectively, compared with year-end 2022. In 2023, the U.S. actual return on assets was 7.41 , which was higher than the expected long-term rate of return of 6.25 . Non-U.S. actual return on assets was 5.56 , which was higher than the expected long-term rate of return of 4.13 . The higher returns are explained primarily by gains on fixed income assets. In total, lower discount rates compared to year-end 2022, partially offset by asset gains in excess of our assumptions resulted in a net remeasurement loss of 1.8 billion, which has been recognized within net periodic benefit cost and reported as a special item. \\n \\n For 2024, the expected long-term rate of return on assets is 5.93 for U.S. plans, down 32 basis points from 2023, reflecting lower capital market return expectations, and 4.53 for non-U.S. plans, up 40 basis points compared with a year ago, reflecting return expectations in those markets and a higher return seeking mix for certain plans. \\n \\n De-risking Strategy . We employ a broad de-risking strategy for our global funded plans that increases the matching characteristics of our assets relative to our obligation as funded status improves. Changes in interest rates, which directly influence changes in discount rates, in addition to other factors have a significant impact on the value of our pension obligation and fixed income asset portfolio. Our de-risking strategy has increased the allocation to fixed income investments and reduced our funded status sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates should result in offsetting effects in the value of our pension obligation and the value of the fixed income asset portfolio. \\n 84 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Sensitivity Analysis. The December 31, 2023 pension funded status and 2024 expense are affected by year-end 2023 assumptions. Sensitivities to these assumptions may be asymmetric and are specific to the time periods noted. The effects of changes in the factors that generally have the largest impact on year-end funded status and pension expense are discussed below. \\n \\n Discount rates and interest rates have the largest impact on our obligations and fixed income assets. The table below estimates the effect on our funded status of an increase/decrease in discount rates and interest rates (in millions): Basis Point Change Increase/(Decrease) in \\n December 31, 2023 Funded Status \\n Factor U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans Discount rate - obligation +/- 100 bps 2,900/ (3,400) 2,700/ (3,400) Interest rate - fixed income assets +/- 100 (2,800)/3,200 (1,800)/2,200 Net impact on funded status 100/ (200) 900/ (1,200) \\n \\n The fixed income asset sensitivity shown excludes other fixed income return components (e.g., changes in credit spreads, bond coupon and active management excess returns), and growth asset returns. Other factors that affect net funded status (e.g., contributions) are not reflected. \\n \\n Interest rates and the expected long-term rate of return on assets have the largest effect on pension expense. These assumptions are generally set at each year-end for expense recorded throughout the following year. The table below estimates the effect on pension expense of a higher/lower assumption for these factors (in millions): Basis Point Change Increase/(Decrease) in 2024 Pension Expense Factor U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans Interest rate - service cost and interest cost +/- 25 bps 25/ (25) 15/ (15) Expected long-term rate of return on assets +/- 25 (75)/75 (55)/55 \\n \\n The effect of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities. The sensitivity of pension expense to a change in discount rate assumptions may not be linear. \\n \\n Other Postretirement Employee Benefits \\n \\n Effect of Actual Results . The weighted average discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation for worldwide OPEB plans at December 31, 2023 was 5.10 , compared with 5.48 at December 31, 2022, resulting in a worldwide net remeasurement loss of 286 million, which has been recognized within net periodic benefit cost and reported as a special item. \\n \\n Sensitivity Analysis. Discount rates and interest rates have the largest effect on our OPEB obligation and expense. The table below estimates the effect on 2024 OPEB expense of higher/lower assumptions for these factors (in millions): Worldwide OPEB Basis Point Change (Increase)/Decrease 2023 YE Obligation Increase/(Decrease) 2024 Expense Factor Discount rate - obligation +/- 100 bps 450/ (540) N/A Interest rate - service cost and interest cost +/- 25 N/A 5/ (5) \\n \\n Income Taxes \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required. We must make estimates and apply judgment in determining the provision for income taxes for financial reporting purposes. We make these estimates and judgments primarily in the following areas: (i) the calculation of tax credits, (ii) the calculation of differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax reporting and financial statement purposes, as well as (iii) the calculation of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Changes in these estimates and judgments may result in a material increase or decrease to our tax provision, which would be recorded in the period in which the change occurs. \\n 85 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Assumptions and Approach Used. We are subject to the income tax laws and regulations of the many jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws and regulations are complex and involve uncertainties in the application to our facts and circumstances that may be open to interpretation. We recognize benefits for these uncertain tax positions based upon a process that requires judgment regarding the technical application of the laws, regulations, and various related judicial opinions. If, in our judgment, it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50 that the uncertain tax position will be settled favorably for us, we estimate an amount that ultimately will be realized. This process is inherently subjective since it requires our assessment of the probability of future outcomes. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis, including consideration of changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial opinions, as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. Changes to our estimate of the amount to be realized are recorded in our provision for income taxes during the period in which the change occurred. \\n \\n We must also assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income and reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized. \\n \\n This assessment, which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis, takes into account various types of evidence, including the following: \\n \\n Nature, frequency, and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses. A pattern of objectively measured recent financial reporting losses is heavily weighted as a source of negative evidence. We generally consider cumulative pre-tax losses in the three-year period ending with the current quarter to be significant negative evidence regarding future profitability. We also consider the strength and trend of earnings, as well as other relevant factors. In certain circumstances, historical information may not be as relevant due to changes in our business operations; \\n \\n Sources of future taxable income. Future reversals of existing temporary differences are heavily weighted sources of objectively verifiable positive evidence. Projections of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences are a source of positive evidence only when the projections are combined with a history of recent profits and can be reasonably estimated. Otherwise, these projections are considered inherently subjective and generally will not be sufficient to overcome negative evidence that includes relevant cumulative losses in recent years, particularly if the projected future taxable income is dependent on an anticipated turnaround to profitability that has not yet been achieved. In such cases, we generally give these projections of future taxable income no weight for the purposes of our valuation allowance assessment; and \\n \\n Tax planning strategies. If necessary and available, tax planning strategies could be implemented to accelerate taxable amounts to utilize expiring carryforwards. These strategies would be a source of additional positive evidence and, depending on their nature, could be heavily weighted. \\n \\n In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider the trade-offs between cash preservation and cash outlays to preserve tax credits. We presently believe that global valuation allowances of 4.2 billion are required and that we ultimately will recover the remaining 16 billion of deferred tax assets. However, the ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets is subject to a number of variables, including our future profitability within relevant tax jurisdictions, and future tax planning and the related effects on our cash and liquidity position. Accordingly, our valuation allowances may increase or decrease in future periods. \\n \\n For additional information regarding income taxes, see Note 7 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. \\n 86 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Impairment of Long-Lived Assets \\n \\n Asset groups are tested at the level of the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Asset groupings for impairment analysis are reevaluated when events occur, such as changes in organizational structure and management reporting. Following the organizational and segment structure change in the beginning of 2023, our asset groups are: Ford Blue North America, Ford Blue Europe, Ford Blue Rest of World, Ford Model e, Ford Pro, Ford Credit, and Ford Next. \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required - Held-and-Used Long-Lived Assets. We test our long-lived asset groups when changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable. Events that trigger a test for recoverability include material adverse changes in projected revenues or expenses, present cash flow losses combined with a history of cash flow losses and a forecast that demonstrates significant continuing losses, significant negative industry or economic trends (including a substantial shift in consumer preference), a current expectation that a long-lived asset group will be disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life, a significant adverse change in the manner in which an asset group is used or in its physical condition, or when there is a change in the asset grouping. In addition, investing in new, emerging products (e.g., EVs) or services (e.g., connectivity) may require substantial upfront investment, which may result in initial forecasted negative cash flows in the near term. In these instances, near-term negative cash flows on their own may not be indicative of a triggering event for evaluation of impairment. In such circumstances, we also conduct a qualitative evaluation of the business growth trajectory, which includes updating our assessment of when positive cash flows are expected to be generated, confirming whether established milestones are being achieved, and assessing our ability and intent to continue to access required funding to execute the plan. If this evaluation indicates a triggering event has occurred, a test for recoverability is performed. \\n \\n When a triggering event occurs, a test for recoverability is performed, comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group. If the undiscounted forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, the asset group s fair value is measured relying primarily on a discounted cash flow method. To the extent available, we will also consider third-party valuations of our long-lived assets that were prepared for other business purposes. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value. When an impairment loss is recognized for assets to be held and used, the adjusted carrying amounts of those assets are depreciated over their remaining useful life. \\n \\n Assumptions and Approach Used - Held-and-Used Long-Lived Assets. The fair value of an asset group is determined from the perspective of a market-participant considering, among other things, appropriate discount rates, valuation techniques, the most advantageous market, and assumptions about the highest and best use of the asset group. \\n \\n We measure the fair value of an asset group based on market prices (i.e., the amount for which the asset could be sold to a third party) when available. When market prices are not available, we generally estimate the fair value of the asset group using the income approach and/or the market approach. The income approach uses cash flow projections. Inherent in our development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results, business plan forecasts, expected growth rates, and cost of capital, similar to those a market participant would use to assess fair value. We also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions and other data. Many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management, and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods. \\n \\n Changes in assumptions or estimates can materially affect the fair value measurement of an asset group and, therefore, can affect the test results. The following are key assumptions we use in making cash flow projections: \\n \\n Business projections. We make assumptions about the demand for our products in the marketplace. These \\n assumptions drive our planning assumptions for volume, mix, and pricing. We also make assumptions about our cost levels (e.g., capacity utilization, cost performance). These projections are derived using our internal business plan forecasts that are updated at least annually and reviewed by our Board of Directors. \\n \\n Long-term growth rate. A growth rate is used to calculate the terminal value of the business and is added to the present value of the debt-free interim cash flows. The growth rate is the expected rate at which an asset group s earnings stream is projected to grow beyond the planning period. \\n \\n Discount rate. When measuring possible impairment, future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted-average cost of capital that we anticipate a potential market participant would use. Weighted-average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall risk-adjusted pre-tax rate of return expected by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise. \\n 87 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Economic projections. Assumptions regarding general economic conditions are included in and affect our assumptions regarding industry sales and pricing estimates for our vehicles. These macroeconomic assumptions include, but are not limited to, industry sales volumes, inflation, interest rates, prices of raw materials (e.g., commodities), and foreign currency exchange rates. \\n \\n The market approach is another method for measuring the fair value of an asset group. This approach relies on the market value (i.e., market capitalization) of companies that are engaged in the same or a similar line of business as the asset group being evaluated. In addition, to the extent available we also consider third-party valuations that were prepared for other business purposes. \\n \\n During 2023, we identified triggering events related to our Ford Blue Europe asset group. In each situation in which we experienced a triggering event during the year, we tested our long-lived assets for impairment using our internal economic and business projections, and determined that the carrying values of the long-lived assets were recoverable. If, in future quarters, our economic or business projections were to change as a result of an update to our plans, a deterioration of the economic or business environment, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used, or an expectation that a long-lived asset group will be disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life, we would undertake additional testing, as appropriate, which could result in an impairment of long-lived assets. \\n\\nAllowance for Credit Losses \\n \\n The allowance for credit losses represents Ford Credit s estimate of the expected lifetime credit losses inherent in finance receivables as of the balance sheet date. The adequacy of Ford Credit s allowance for credit losses is assessed quarterly, and the assumptions and models used in establishing the allowance are evaluated regularly. Because credit losses can vary substantially over time, estimating credit losses requires a number of assumptions about matters that are uncertain. Changes in assumptions affect Ford Credit interest, operating, and other expenses on our consolidated income statements and the allowance for credit losses contained within Ford Credit finance receivables, net on our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding allowance for credit losses. \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required. Ford Credit estimates the allowance for credit losses for receivables that share similar risk characteristics based on a collective assessment using a combination of measurement models and management judgment. The models consider factors such as historical trends in credit losses, recent portfolio performance, and forward-looking macroeconomic conditions. The models vary by portfolio and receivable type including consumer finance receivables, wholesale loans, and dealer loans. If Ford Credit does not believe the models reflect lifetime expected credit losses for the portfolio, an adjustment is made to reflect management judgment regarding qualitative factors, including economic uncertainty, observable changes in portfolio performance, and other relevant factors. \\n\\n88 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Assumptions Used. Ford Credit s allowance for credit losses is based on its assumptions regarding: \\n \\n Probability of default . The expected probability of payment and time to default, which include assumptions about macroeconomic factors and recent performance; and \\n Loss given default. The percentage of the expected balance due at default that is not recoverable. The loss given default takes into account expected collateral value and future recoveries. \\n \\n Macroeconomic factors used in Ford Credit s models are country specific and include variables such as unemployment rates, personal bankruptcy filings, housing prices, and gross domestic product. \\n \\n Sensitivity Analysis. Changes in the probability of default and loss given default assumptions would affect the allowance for credit losses. The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions for Ford Credit s U.S. Ford and Lincoln retail financing is as follows (in millions): Assumption Basis Point Change \\n Increase/(Decrease) Probability of default (lifetime) +/- 100 bps 230/ (230) Loss given default +/- 100 10/(10) \\n \\n Accumulated Depreciation on Vehicles Subject to Operating Leases \\n \\n Accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases reduces the value of the leased vehicles in Ford Credit s operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their expected residual value at the end of the lease term. \\n \\n Ford Credit monitors residual values each month, and it reviews the adequacy of accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis. If Ford Credit believes that the expected residual values for its vehicles have changed, it revises depreciation to ensure that net investment in operating leases (equal to the acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation) will be adjusted to reflect Ford Credit s revised estimate of the expected residual value at the end of the lease term. Adjustments to depreciation expense result in a change in the depreciation rates of the vehicles subject to operating leases and are recorded prospectively on a straight-line basis. \\n \\n Generally, lease customers have the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer. \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required. Each operating lease in Ford Credit s portfolio represents a vehicle it owns that has been leased to a customer. At the time Ford Credit purchases a lease, it establishes an expected residual value for the vehicle. Ford Credit estimates the expected residual value by evaluating recent auction values, return volumes for its leased vehicles, industrywide used vehicle prices, marketing incentive plans, and vehicle quality data. \\n \\n Assumptions Used. Ford Credit s accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases is based on assumptions regarding: \\n \\n Auction value. Ford Credit s projection of the market value of the vehicles when sold at the end of the lease; and \\n Return volume. Ford Credit s projection of the number of vehicles that will be returned at lease-end. \\n \\n See Note 12 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases. \\n\\n89 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Sensitivity Analysis. For returned vehicles, Ford Credit faces a risk that the amount it obtains from the vehicle sold at auction will be less than its estimate of the expected residual value for the vehicle. The impact of the change in assumptions on future auction values and return volumes would increase or decrease accumulated supplemental depreciation and depreciation expense over the remaining terms of the operating leases; however, the impact may be tempered or exacerbated based on future auction values in relation to the purchase price specified in the lease contract. A change in the assumption for an auction value will impact Ford Credit s estimate of accumulated supplemental depreciation if the future auction value is lower than the purchase price specified in the lease contract. The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions for Ford Credit s U.S. Ford and Lincoln operating lease portfolio is as follows (in millions): Assumption Basis Point \\n Change \\n Increase/(Decrease) Future auction values +/- 100 bps (20)/ 20 Return volumes +/- 100 5/(5) \\n \\n Adjustments to the amount of accumulated supplemental depreciation on operating leases are reflected on our balance sheets as Net investment in operating leases and on our income statements in Ford Credit interest, operating, and other expenses. \\n\\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS ISSUED BUT NOT YET ADOPTED \\n \\n For a discussion of recent accounting standards, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. \\n \\n 90</td>\n",

       "      <td>ITEM 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \\n\\nKey Trends and Economic Factors Affecting Ford and the Automotive Industry \\n \\n COVID-19 and Supplier Disruptions. The impact of COVID-19, including changes in consumer behavior, pandemic fears and market downturns, and restrictions on business and individual activities, has created significant volatility in the global economy. Outbreaks in certain regions continue to cause intermittent COVID-19-related disruptions in our supply chain and local manufacturing operations. We also continue to face supplier disruptions due to labor shortages and other production issues, in addition to the continuing semiconductor shortage. Our inconsistent production schedule has been disruptive to our suppliers operations, which, in turn, has led to higher costs and production shortfalls. Further, actions taken by Russia in Ukraine have impacted and could further impact our suppliers, particularly our lower tier suppliers, as well as our operations in Europe. For additional information on the impact of supplier disruptions, see the Outlook section on page 73 . \\n \\n Currency Exchange Rate Volatility. After aggressively easing monetary policy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve, and other central banks around the world, in 2022 began to withdraw monetary stimulus by raising interest rates. Periods of monetary policy tightening are often associated with heightened financial market and currency volatility, especially for those markets that are outliers in terms of their economic or monetary policy backdrop. This is notable for many emerging markets, which may also face increased exposure to commodity prices and political instability, contributing to unpredictable movements in the value of their exchange rates. In addition to direct impacts on the financial flows of global automotive companies, currency movements can also impact pricing of vehicles exported to overseas markets. In most markets, exchange rates are market-determined, and all are impacted by many different macroeconomic and policy factors, and thus likely to remain volatile. However, in some markets, exchange rates are heavily influenced or controlled by governments. \\n \\n Pricing Pressure. Over the last year, prices of both new and used vehicles have increased substantially due to strong demand, supply shortages, and inflationary costs. We have already observed some moderation in the rate of price increases as auto production slowly recovers from the semiconductor shortage, but it is unclear whether prices will decline fully to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. Over the long term, intense competition and excess capacity are likely to put downward pressure on inflation-adjusted prices for similarly-contented vehicles and contribute to a challenging pricing environment for the automotive industry in most major markets. \\n \\n Commodity and Energy Prices. Prices for commodities remain volatile. In some cases, spot prices for various commodities have recently diverged somewhat, as anticipated weakening in global industrial activity mitigates price increases for base metals such as steel and aluminum, while precious metals (e.g., palladium), and raw materials that are used in batteries for electric vehicles (e.g., lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, among other materials, for batteries) remain high. The net impact on us and our suppliers has been higher material costs overall. To help ensure supply of raw materials for critical components (e.g., batteries), we, like others in the industry, have entered into multi-year sourcing agreements and may enter into additional agreements. Similar dynamics are impacting energy markets, with Europe particularly exposed to the risk of both higher prices and constraints on supply of natural gas due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Such shortages may impact facilities operated by us or our suppliers, which could have an impact on us in Europe and other regions. In the long term, the outcome of de-carbonization and electrification of the vehicle fleet may depress oil demand, but the global energy transition will also contribute to ongoing volatility of oil and other energy prices. For additional information on commodity costs, see the Outlook section on page 73 . \\n \\n Vehicle Profitability. Our financial results depend on the profitability of the vehicles we sell, which may vary significantly by vehicle line. In general, larger vehicles tend to command higher prices and be more profitable than smaller vehicles, both across and within vehicle segments. For example, in North America, our larger, more profitable vehicles had an average contribution margin that was 120 of our total average contribution margin across all vehicles, whereas our smaller vehicles had significantly lower contribution margins. In addition, government regulations aimed at reducing emissions and increasing fuel efficiency (e.g., ZEV mandates and low emission zones), and other factors that accelerate the transition to electrified vehicles, may increase the cost of vehicles by more than the perceived benefit to consumers and dampen margins. \\n\\n35 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Trade Policy. To the extent governments in various regions implement or intensify barriers to imports, such as erecting tariff or non-tariff barriers or manipulating their currency, and provide advantages to local exporters selling into the global marketplace, there can be a significant negative impact on manufacturers based in other markets. While we believe the long-term trend will support the growth of free trade, we will continue to monitor and address developing issues. \\n \\n Inflation and Interest Rates. We continue to see near-term impacts on our business due to inflation, including ongoing global price pressures in the wake of Russia s invasion of Ukraine, driving up energy prices, freight premiums, and other operating costs above normal rates. Although headline inflation in the United States and Europe appears to have peaked, as gasoline and natural gas prices recede from the latest spike, core inflation (excluding food and energy prices) remains elevated and is a source of continued cost pressure on businesses and households. Interest rates have increased significantly as central banks in developed countries attempt to subdue inflation while government deficits and debt remain at high levels in many global markets. Accordingly, the eventual implications of higher government deficits and debt, tighter monetary policy, and potentially higher long-term interest rates may drive a higher cost of capital for the business. At Ford Credit, rising interest rates may impact its ability to source funding and offer financing at competitive rates, which could reduce its financing margin. \\n \\n Revenue \\n \\n Our Automotive segment revenue is generated primarily by sales of vehicles, parts, and accessories. Revenue is recorded when control is transferred to our customers (generally, our dealers and distributors). For the majority of sales, this occurs when products are shipped from our manufacturing facilities. However, we defer a portion of the consideration received when there is a separate future or stand-ready performance obligation, such as extended service contracts or ongoing vehicle connectivity. Revenue related to extended service contracts is recognized over the term of the agreement in proportion to the costs we expect to incur in satisfying the contract obligations; revenue related to other future or stand-ready performance obligations is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the period in which services are expected to be performed. Vehicles sold to daily rental car companies with an obligation to repurchase for a guaranteed amount, exercisable at the option of the customer, are accounted for as operating leases, with lease revenue recognized over the term of the lease. Proceeds from the sale of vehicles at auction are recognized in revenue upon transfer of control of the vehicle to the buyer. \\n \\n Most of the vehicles sold by us to our dealers and distributors are financed at wholesale by Ford Credit. Upon Ford Credit originating the wholesale receivable related to a dealer s purchase of a vehicle, Ford Credit pays cash to the relevant Automotive legal entity in payment of the dealer s obligation for the purchase price of the vehicle. The dealer then pays the wholesale finance receivable to Ford Credit when it sells the vehicle to a retail customer. \\n \\n Our Ford Credit segment revenue is generated primarily from interest on finance receivables and revenue from operating leases. Revenue from interest on finance receivables is recognized over the term of the receivable using the interest method and includes the amortization of certain deferred origination costs. Revenue from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. \\n \\n Transactions between our Automotive and Ford Credit segments occur in the ordinary course of business. For example, we offer special retail financing and lease incentives to dealers customers who choose to finance or lease our vehicles from Ford Credit. The cost for these incentives is included in our estimate of variable consideration at the date the related vehicle sales to our dealers are recorded. In order to compensate Ford Credit for the lower interest or lease payments offered to the retail customer, we pay the discounted value of the incentive directly to Ford Credit when it originates the retail finance or lease contract with the dealer s customer. Ford Credit recognizes the incentive amount over the life of retail finance contracts as an element of financing revenue and over the life of lease contracts as a reduction to depreciation. See Note 1 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of transactions between our Automotive and Ford Credit segments. \\n\\n36 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Costs and Expenses \\n \\n Our income statement classifies our Company excluding Ford Credit total costs and expenses into two categories: (i) cost of sales, and (ii) selling, administrative, and other expenses. We include within cost of sales those costs related to the development, production, and distribution of our vehicles, parts, accessories, and services. Specifically, we include in cost of sales each of the following: material costs (including commodity costs); freight costs; warranty, including product recall costs; labor and other costs related to the development and production of our vehicles and connectivity, parts, accessories, and services; depreciation and amortization; and other associated costs. We include within selling, administrative, and other expenses labor and other costs not directly related to the development and production of our vehicles, parts, accessories, and services, including such expenses as advertising and sales promotion costs. \\n \\n Certain of our costs, such as material costs, generally vary directly with changes in volume and mix of production. In our industry, production volume often varies significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. Quarterly production volumes experience seasonal shifts throughout the year (including peak retail sales seasons and the impact on production of model changeover and new product launches). Annual production volumes are heavily impacted by external economic factors, including the pace of economic growth and factors such as the availability of consumer credit and cost of fuel. \\n \\n As a result, we analyze the profit impact of certain cost changes holding constant present-year volume and mix and currency exchange, in order to evaluate our cost trends absent the impact of varying production and currency exchange levels. We analyze these cost changes in the following categories: \\n \\n Contribution Costs these costs typically vary with production volume. These costs include material (including commodity), warranty, and freight and duty costs. \\n \\n Structural Costs these costs typically do not have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume. These costs include manufacturing; vehicle and software engineering; spending-related; advertising and sales promotion; administrative, information technology, and selling; and pension and OPEB costs. \\n \\n While contribution costs generally vary directly in proportion to production volume, elements within our structural costs category are impacted to differing degrees by changes in production volume. We also have varying degrees of discretion when it comes to controlling the different elements within our structural costs. For example, depreciation and amortization expense largely is associated with prior capital spending decisions. On the other hand, while labor costs do not vary directly with production volume, manufacturing labor costs may be impacted by changes in volume, for example when we increase overtime, add a production shift, or add personnel to support volume increases. Other structural costs, such as advertising or engineering costs, do not necessarily have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume. Our structural costs generally are within our discretion, although to varying degrees, and can be adjusted over time in response to external factors. \\n \\n We consider certain structural costs to be a direct investment in future growth and revenue. For example, structural costs are necessary to grow our business and improve profitability, invest in new products and technologies, respond to increasing industry sales volume, and grow our market share. \\n \\n Cost of sales and Selling, administrative, and other expenses for full year 2022 were 145.3 billion. Our Automotive segment s material and commodity costs make up the largest portion of these costs and expenses, followed by structural costs. Although material costs are our largest absolute cost, our margins can be affected significantly by changes in any category of costs. \\n 37 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 2022 \\n \\n The net loss attributable to Ford Motor Company was 1,981 million in 2022. Company adjusted EBIT was 10,415 million. \\n \\n Net income/(loss) includes certain items special items that are excluded from Company adjusted EBIT. These items are discussed in more detail in Note 26 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. We report special items separately to allow investors analyzing our results to identify certain infrequent significant items that they may wish to exclude when considering the trend of ongoing operating results. Our pre-tax and tax special items were as follows (in millions): \\n 2021 2022 Global Redesign Europe (530) (151) India (468) (298) South America (803) 53 China (including Taiwan) 150 (380) North America (72) (198) Other 3 7 Subtotal Global Redesign (1,720) (967) Other Items Gain/(loss) on Rivian investment \\n 9,096 (7,377) Debt extinguishment premium (1,692) (135) AV strategy including Argo impairment (see Note 14) (2,812) Ford Credit Brazil restructuring (see Note 21) 14 (155) Russia suspension of operations/asset write-off (158) Patent matters related to prior calendar years (124) Other 82 (35) Subtotal Other Items 7,500 (10,796) Pension and OPEB Gain/(Loss) Pension and OPEB remeasurement 3,873 29 Pension settlements and curtailments (70) (438) Subtotal Pension and OPEB Gain/(Loss) 3,803 (409) Total EBIT Special Items 9,583 (12,172) Cash effect of Global Redesign (incl. separations) (1,935) (377) Provision for/(Benefit from) tax special items (a) (1,924) (2,573) \\n __________ \\n (a) Includes related tax effect on special items and tax special items. \\n \\n We recorded 12.2 billion of pre-tax special item charges in 2022, driven by a 7.4 billion mark-to-market net loss on our Rivian investment and a 2.7 billion impairment on our Argo investment. \\n \\n In Note 26 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, special items are reflected as a separate reconciling item, as opposed to being allocated among the Automotive, Mobility, and Ford Credit segments. This reflects the fact that management excludes these items from its review of operating segment results for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources. \\n 38 \\n\\nItem 7.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Definitions and Information Regarding Automotive Causal Factors \\n \\n In general, we measure year-over-year change in Automotive segment EBIT using the causal factors listed below, with net pricing and cost variances calculated at present-year volume and mix and exchange: \\n \\n Market Factors (exclude the impact of unconsolidated affiliate wholesale units): \\n Volume and Mix primarily measures EBIT variance from changes in wholesale unit volumes (at prior-year average contribution margin per unit) driven by changes in industry volume, market share, and dealer stocks, as well as the EBIT variance resulting from changes in product mix, including mix among vehicle lines and mix of trim levels and options within a vehicle line \\n Net Pricing primarily measures EBIT variance driven by changes in wholesale unit prices to dealers and marketing incentive programs such as rebate programs, low-rate financing offers, special lease offers, and stock adjustments on dealer inventory \\n \\n Cost: \\n Contribution Costs primarily measures EBIT variance driven by per-unit changes in cost categories that typically vary with volume, such as material costs (including commodity and component costs), warranty expense, and freight and duty costs \\n Structural Costs primarily measures EBIT variance driven by absolute change in cost categories that typically do not have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume. Structural costs include the following cost categories: \\n Manufacturing, Including Volume-Related - consists primarily of costs for hourly and salaried manufacturing personnel, plant overhead (such as utilities and taxes), and new product launch expense. These costs could be affected by volume for operating pattern actions such as overtime, line-speed, and shift schedules \\n Engineering and Connectivity consists primarily of costs for vehicle and software engineering personnel, prototype materials, testing, and outside engineering and software services \\n Spending-Related consists primarily of depreciation and amortization of our manufacturing and engineering assets, but also includes asset retirements and operating leases \\n Advertising and Sales Promotions includes costs for advertising, marketing programs, brand promotions, customer mailings and promotional events, and auto shows \\n Administrative, Information Technology, and Selling includes primarily costs for salaried personnel and purchased services related to our staff activities, information technology, and selling functions \\n Pension and OPEB consists primarily of past service pension costs and other postretirement employee benefit costs \\n \\n Exchange primarily measures EBIT variance driven by one or more of the following: (i) transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the relevant entities, (ii) effects of converting functional currency income to U.S. dollars, (iii) effects of remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities of the relevant entities in currencies other than their functional currency, or (iv) results of our foreign currency hedging \\n \\n Other includes a variety of items, such as parts and services earnings, royalties, government incentives, and compensation-related changes \\n \\n In addition, definitions and calculations used in this report include: \\n \\n Wholesales and Revenue wholesale unit volumes include all Ford and Lincoln badged units (whether produced by Ford or by an unconsolidated affiliate) that are sold to dealerships or others, units manufactured by Ford that are sold to other manufacturers, units distributed by Ford for other manufacturers, and local brand units produced by our China joint venture, Jiangling Motors Corporation, Ltd. JMC ), that are sold to dealerships or others. Vehicles sold to daily rental car companies that are subject to a guaranteed repurchase option (i.e., rental repurchase), as well as other sales of finished vehicles for which the recognition of revenue is deferred (e.g., consignments), also are included in wholesale unit volumes. Revenue from certain vehicles in wholesale unit volumes (specifically, Ford badged vehicles produced and distributed by our unconsolidated affiliates, as well as JMC brand vehicles) are not included in our revenue \\n \\n Industry Volume and Market Share based, in part, on estimated vehicle registrations; includes medium and heavy duty trucks \\n \\n SAAR seasonally adjusted annual rate \\n 45 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Mobility Segment \\n \\n The Mobility segment primarily includes development costs for Ford s autonomous vehicles and related businesses, Ford s equity ownership in Argo AI (a developer of autonomous driving systems), and other mobility businesses and investments. \\n \\n In our Mobility segment, our 2022 EBIT loss improved 104 million from a year ago. The 926 million EBIT loss reflects our strategic investments in our autonomous vehicle capabilities and support of our mobility initiatives. \\n \\n In the third quarter of 2022, we made the strategic decision to shift our capital spending from L4 technology being developed by Argo AI to advanced L2/L3 systems, which we believe will ultimately be essential to achieve profitable commercialization of L4 autonomy at scale in the future. Additionally, because of the significant additional capital and time required to achieve commercialization of L4, as well as other macroeconomic factors, Argo AI has been unable to attract new investors. After performing external outreach in the third quarter to assess market interest in acquiring either Argo AI or its technology components and conducting internal reviews to evaluate opportunities to leverage Argo AI s technology, Ford determined that Argo AI no longer has value as a going concern. As a result, we reassessed the carrying value of our investment in Argo AI starting from September 30, 2022, and in October, Ford and VW initiated the process of exiting the joint development of L4 technology through Argo AI. Accordingly, in the second half of 2022, we recorded as a special item a 2.7 billion pre-tax impairment on our Argo AI investment, and on October 26, 2022, we announced that Argo AI plans to wind down operations, which is in progress. \\n \\n 46 \\n\\nItem 7.

Ford Credit s loss metrics reflected healthy and stable consumer credit conditions and strong auction values. Ford Credit s U.S. 36-month auction values for off-lease vehicles were up 8 from a year ago, reflecting strong demand for used vehicles, including the impact of lower new vehicle production due to the semiconductor shortage. We are planning for full year 2023 auction values to decrease as supply constraints improve. \\n \\n Ford Credit s 2022 EBT of 2,657 million was 2,060 million lower than a year ago, reflecting lower credit loss and lease residual reserve releases, lower financing margin, and lower lease return rates. \\n \\n 47 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Definitions and Information Regarding Ford Credit Causal Factors \\n \\n In general, we measure year-over-year changes in Ford Credit s EBT using the causal factors listed below: \\n \\n Volume and Mix: \\n Volume primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by changes in average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses at prior period financing margin yield (defined below in financing margin) at prior period exchange rates. Volume changes are primarily driven by the volume of new and used vehicles sold and leased, the extent to which Ford Credit purchases retail financing and operating lease contracts, the extent to which Ford Credit provides wholesale financing, the sales price of the vehicles financed, the level of dealer inventories, Ford-sponsored special financing programs available exclusively through Ford Credit, and the availability of cost-effective funding \\n Mix primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by period-over-period changes in the composition of Ford Credit s average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses by product within each region \\n \\n Financing Margin: \\n Financing margin variance is the period-to-period change in financing margin yield multiplied by the present period average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses at prior period exchange rates. This calculation is performed at the product and country level and then aggregated. Financing margin yield equals revenue, less interest expense and scheduled depreciation for the period, divided by average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses for the same period \\n Financing margin changes are driven by changes in revenue and interest expense. Changes in revenue are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, cost assumptions in pricing, mix of business, and competitive environment. Changes in interest expense are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, borrowing spreads, and asset-liability management \\n \\n Credit Loss: \\n Credit loss is the change in the provision for credit losses at prior period exchange rates. For analysis purposes, management splits the provision for credit losses into net charge-offs and the change in the allowance for credit losses \\n Net charge-off changes are primarily driven by the number of repossessions, severity per repossession, and recoveries. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are primarily driven by changes in historical trends in credit losses and recoveries, changes in the composition and size of Ford Credit s present portfolio, changes in trends in historical used vehicle values, and changes in forward looking macroeconomic conditions. For additional information, refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates - Allowance for Credit Losses section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2022 Form 10-K Report \\n \\n Lease Residual: \\n Lease residual measures changes to residual performance at prior period exchange rates. For analysis purposes, management splits residual performance primarily into residual gains and losses, and the change in accumulated supplemental depreciation \\n Residual gain and loss changes are primarily driven by the number of vehicles returned to Ford Credit and sold, and the difference between the auction value and the depreciated value (which includes both base and accumulated supplemental depreciation) of the vehicles sold. Changes in accumulated supplemental depreciation are primarily driven by changes in Ford Credit s estimate of the expected auction value at the end of the lease term, and changes in Ford Credit s estimate of the number of vehicles that will be returned to it and sold. Depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases includes early termination losses on operating leases due to customer default events. For additional information, refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates - Accumulated Depreciation on Vehicles Subject to Operating Leases section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2022 Form 10-K Report \\n \\n Exchange: \\n Reflects changes in EBT driven by the effects of converting functional currency income to U.S. dollars \\n \\n Other: \\n Primarily includes operating expenses, other revenue, insurance expenses, and other income/(loss) at prior period exchange rates \\n Changes in operating expenses are primarily driven by salaried personnel costs, facilities costs, and costs associated with the origination and servicing of customer contracts \\n In general, other income/(loss) changes are primarily driven by changes in earnings related to market valuation adjustments to derivatives (primarily related to movements in interest rates) and other miscellaneous items \\n 48 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n In addition, the following definitions and calculations apply to Ford Credit when used in this Report: \\n \\n Cash (as shown in the Funding Structure and Liquidity tables) Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, excluding amounts related to insurance activities \\n \\n Debt (as shown in the Key Metrics and Leverage tables) Debt on Ford Credit s balance sheets. Includes debt issued in securitizations and payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets and related enhancements. Ford Credit holds the right to receive the excess cash flows not needed to pay the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions \\n \\n Earnings Before Taxes EBT Reflects Ford Credit s income before income taxes \\n \\n Loss-to-Receivables LTR Ratio LTR ratio is calculated using net charge-offs divided by average finance receivables, excluding unearned interest supplements and the allowance for credit losses \\n \\n Return on Equity ROE (as shown in the Key Metrics table) Reflects return on equity calculated by annualizing net income for the period and dividing by monthly average equity for the period \\n \\n Securitization and Restricted Cash (as shown in the Liquidity table) Securitization cash is held for the benefit of the securitization investors (for example, a reserve fund). Restricted cash primarily includes cash held to meet certain local governmental and regulatory reserve requirements and cash held under the terms of certain contractual agreements \\n \\n Securitizations (as shown in the Public Term Funding Plan table) Public securitization transactions, Rule 144A offerings sponsored by Ford Credit, and widely distributed offerings by Ford Credit Canada \\n \\n Term Asset-Backed Securities (as shown in the Funding Structure table) Obligations issued in securitization transactions that are payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets and related enhancements \\n \\n Total Net Receivables (as shown in the Key Metrics table) Includes finance receivables (retail financing and wholesale) sold for legal purposes and net investment in operating leases included in securitization transactions that do not satisfy the requirements for accounting sale treatment. These receivables and operating leases are reported on Ford Credit s balance sheets and are available only for payment of the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions; they are not available to pay the other obligations of Ford Credit or the claims of Ford Credit s other creditors \\n\\nCorporate Other \\n \\n Corporate Other primarily includes corporate governance expenses, interest income (excluding interest earned on our extended service contract portfolio that is included in our Automotive segment) and gains and losses from our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding gains and losses on investments in equity securities), and foreign exchange derivatives gains and losses associated with intercompany lending. Corporate governance expenses are primarily administrative, delivering benefit on behalf of the global enterprise, that are not allocated to operating segments. These include expenses related to setting and directing global policy, providing oversight and stewardship, and promoting the Company s interests. For full year 2022, Corporate Other had a 1,008 million loss, compared with a 1,084 million loss in 2021. The improvement was driven by higher Automotive interest income due to higher interest rates (primarily Fed Funds). \\n\\nInterest on Debt \\n \\n Interest on Debt consists of interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit. Our full year 2022 interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit was 1,259 million, 544 million lower than in 2021, primarily explained by U.S. debt restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2021 and during 2022. \\n \\n 49 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Taxes \\n \\n Our Provision for/(Benefit from) income taxes for full year 2022 was a 864 million benefit, resulting in an effective tax rate of 28.6 . This includes benefits arising from the reversal of U.S. valuation allowances, primarily as a result of planning actions. \\n \\n Our full year 2022 adjusted effective tax rate, which excludes special items, was 18.7 . \\n \\n We regularly review our organizational structure and income tax elections for affiliates in non-U.S. and U.S. tax jurisdictions, which may result in changes in affiliates that are included in or excluded from our U.S. tax return. Any future changes to our structure, as well as any changes in income tax laws in the countries that we operate, could cause increases or decreases to our deferred tax balances and related valuation allowances. \\n 50 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 2021 \\n \\n The net income attributable to Ford Motor Company was 17,937 million in 2021. Company adjusted EBIT was 10,000 million. \\n \\n Net income/(loss) includes certain items special items that are excluded from Company adjusted EBIT. These items are discussed in more detail in Note 26 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. We report special items separately to allow investors analyzing our results to identify certain infrequent significant items that they may wish to exclude when considering the trend of ongoing operating results. Our pre-tax and tax special items were as follows (in millions): \\n 2020 2021 Global Redesign Europe (727) (530) India (23) (468) South America (2,486) (803) Russia 18 5 China (including Taiwan) (56) 150 Separations and Other (not included above) (94) (74) Subtotal Global Redesign (3,368) (1,720) Other Items Gain on transaction with Argo AI 3,454 Gain on Rivian IPO and mark-to-market \\n 143 9,096 Gains and losses on investments in equity securities (excl.

The gains were partially offset by costs associated with our Global Redesign actions and a debt extinguishment premium associated with the repurchase and redemption of 7.6 billion of our higher-coupon debt. \\n \\n In Note 26 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, special items are reflected as a separate reconciling item, as opposed to being allocated among the Automotive, Mobility, and Ford Credit segments. This reflects the fact that management excludes these items from its review of operating segment results for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources. \\n 51 \\n\\nItem 7.

Ford Credit s loss metrics reflected healthy and stable consumer credit conditions and strong auction values. Ford Credit s U.S. 36-month auction values for off-lease vehicles were up 26 from 2020, reflecting strong demand for used vehicles, including the impact of lower new vehicle production due to the semiconductor shortage. \\n \\n Ford Credit s 2021 EBT increased 2,109 million from 2020, explained primarily by favorable operating lease residual performance, the non-recurrence of the 2020 increase to the credit loss reserve due to deterioration in macroeconomic conditions related to COVID-19, and reductions in the credit loss reserve in 2021, partially offset by lower volume driven by the impact of the global semiconductor shortage and lower financing margin. \\n 58 \\n\\nItem 7.

The higher loss was driven by lower interest income and higher administrative and IT-related expenses. \\n\\nInterest on Debt \\n \\n Our full year 2021 interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit was 1,803 million, 154 million higher than in 2020, primarily explained by higher U.S. unsecured debt interest expense. \\n\\nTaxes \\n \\n Our Provision for/(Benefit from) income taxes for full year 2021 was a 130 million benefit, resulting in an effective tax rate of negative 0.7 . This includes a benefit of 2.9 billion to recognize deferred tax assets resulting from changes in our global tax structure and a 918 million benefit from the reversal of U.S. valuation allowances. \\n \\n Our full year 2021 adjusted effective tax rate, which excludes special items, was 21.9 . \\n 59 \\n\\nItem 7.

One of our key priorities is to maintain a strong balance sheet, while at the same time having resources available to invest in and grow our business. At December 31, 2022, we had Company cash of 32.3 billion and liquidity of 48.0 billion, including approximately 194 million of Rivian marketable securities. In 2022, we sold approximately 91 million of our Rivian shares resulting in proceeds of about 3 billion. As marketable securities increase or decrease in value, Company cash and liquidity will likewise increase or decrease. At December 31, 2022, about 89 of Company cash was held by consolidated entities domiciled in the United States. \\n \\n To be prepared for an economic downturn, we target an ongoing Company cash balance at or above 20 billion plus significant additional liquidity above our Company cash target. We expect to have periods when we will be above or below this amount due to: (i) future cash flow expectations, such as for investments in future opportunities, capital investments, debt maturities, pension contributions, or restructuring requirements, (ii) short-term timing differences, and (iii) changes in the global economic environment. \\n \\n Our Company cash investments (excluding the Rivian marketable securities) primarily include U.S. Department of Treasury obligations, federal agency securities, bank time deposits with investment-grade institutions, investment-grade corporate securities, investment-grade commercial paper, and debt obligations of a select group of non-U.S. governments, non-U.S. governmental agencies, and supranational institutions. The average maturity of these investments is approximately one year and adjusted based on market conditions and liquidity needs. We monitor our Company cash levels and average maturity on a daily basis. \\n\\n60 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Material Cash Requirements. Our material cash requirements include: \\n \\n Capital expenditures (for additional information, see the Changes in Company Cash section below) and other payments for engineering, software, product development, and implementation of our plans for electric vehicles \\n \\n Purchase of raw materials and components to support the manufacturing and sale of vehicles (including electric vehicles), parts, and accessories (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table and the accompanying description of our Purchase obligations below) \\n \\n Marketing incentive payments to dealers \\n \\n Payments for warranty and field service actions (for additional information, see Note 25 of the Notes to the Financial Statements) \\n \\n Debt repayments (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table below and Note 19 of the Notes the Financial Statements) \\n \\n Discretionary and mandatory payments to our global pension plans (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table below, the Changes in Company Cash section below, and Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements) \\n \\n Employee wages, benefits, and incentives \\n \\n Operating lease payments (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table below and Note 18 of the Notes to the Financial Statements) \\n \\n Cash effects related to the global redesign of our business (for additional information, see the Changes in Company Cash section below) \\n \\n Strategic acquisitions and investments to grow our business, including electrification \\n \\n Subject to approval by our Board of Directors, shareholder distributions in the form of dividend payments and/or a share repurchase program (including share repurchases to offset the anti-dilutive effect of increased shared-based compensation) may require the expenditure of a material amount of cash. Moreover, we may be subject to additional material cash requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, e.g., legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions, and other matters. \\n \\n We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties, and, as noted above, such commitments require a material amount of cash. Most of these are debt obligations incurred by our Ford Credit segment. In addition, as part of our normal business practices, we enter into contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components, and services to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services. These arrangements, including multi-year offtake commitments, may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase requirements. Purchase obligations in the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table below are defined as off-balance sheet agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms; however, as we purchase raw materials and components beyond the minimum amounts required by the Purchase obligations, our material cash requirements for these items are higher than what is reflected in the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table. For additional information on the timing of these payments and the impact on our working capital, see the Changes in Company Cash section below. \\n 61 \\n\\nItem 7.

For long-term debt with variable-rate interest, we estimate the future interest payments based on projected market interest rates for various floating-rate benchmarks received from third parties. \\n (c) Includes interest payments of 139 million. \\n (d) Excludes approximately 300 million in future lease payments for various operating leases commencing in a future period. \\n (e) Amounts represent our estimate of contractually obligated contributions to the Ford-Werke plan. See Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for further information regarding our expected 2022 pension contributions and funded status. \\n (f) Purchase obligations under existing offtake agreements for scarce raw materials are not included in the table above. As of December 31, 2022, our forecasted expenditures for the maximum quantity that may be purchased under these offtake agreements, which are subject to satisfaction of the conditions in the agreements, total about 2.4 billion through 2029 based on our present pricing forecast; however, our forecasted prices could fluctuate significantly from period to period, which would result in volatility in the estimate of our overall obligation. In addition, we plan to continue to enter into offtake agreements with raw material suppliers, the costs under which we expect to be significant. \\n \\n We plan to utilize our liquidity (as described above) and our cash flows from business operations to fund our material cash requirements. \\n \\n Changes in Company Cash. In managing our business, we classify changes in Company cash into operating and non-operating items. Operating items include: Company adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit EBT, capital spending, depreciation and tooling amortization, changes in working capital, Ford Credit distributions, interest on debt, cash taxes, and all other and timing differences (including timing differences between accrual-based EBIT and associated cash flows). Non-operating items include: global redesign (including separation payments), changes in Company debt excluding Ford Credit, contributions to funded pension plans, shareholder distributions, and other items (including gains and losses on investments in equity securities, acquisitions and divestitures, equity investments, and other transactions with Ford Credit). \\n\\n62 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n With respect to Changes in working capital, in general we carry relatively low Automotive segment trade receivables compared with our trade payables because the majority of our Automotive wholesales are financed (primarily by Ford Credit) immediately upon the sale of vehicles to dealers, which generally occurs shortly after being produced. In contrast, our Automotive trade payables are based primarily on industry-standard production supplier payment terms of about 45 days. As a result, our cash flow deteriorates if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) decrease while trade payables continue to become due. Conversely, our cash flow improves if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) increase while new trade payables are generally not due for about 45 days. For example, the suspension of production at most of our assembly plants and lower industry volumes due to COVID-19 in early 2020 resulted in an initial deterioration of our cash flow, while the subsequent resumption of manufacturing operations and return to pre-COVID-19 production levels at most of our assembly plants resulted in a subsequent improvement of our cash flow. Even in normal economic conditions, however, these working capital balances generally are subject to seasonal changes that can impact cash flow. For example, we typically experience cash flow timing differences associated with inventories and payables due to our annual summer and December shutdown periods when production, and therefore inventories and wholesale volumes, are usually at their lowest levels, while payables continue to come due and be paid. The net impact of this typically results in cash outflows from changes in our working capital balances during these shutdown periods. \\n \\n Our finished product inventory at December 31, 2022 was higher year over year due to production and release scheduling, which resulted in higher sales inventory, in-transit inventory, and units awaiting upfit. \\n \\n In response to, or in anticipation of, supplier disruptions, we may stockpile certain components or raw materials to help prevent disruption in our production of vehicles. Such actions could have a short-term adverse impact on our cash and increase our inventory. Moreover, in order to secure critical materials for production of electric vehicles, we have entered into and plan to continue to enter into offtake agreements with raw material suppliers and make investments in certain raw material and battery suppliers, including contributing up to 6.6 billion in capital to BlueOval SK, LLC over a five-year period ending in 2026. Such investments, which are part of our plan to invest over 50 billion in electric vehicles through 2026, could have an additional adverse impact on our cash in the near-term. \\n \\n The terms of the offtake agreements we have entered into, and those we may enter into in the future, vary by transaction, though they generally obligate us to purchase a certain percentage or minimum amount of output produced by the counterparty over an agreed upon period of time. The purchase price mechanism included in the offtake agreement is typically based on the market price of the material at the time of delivery. The terms also may include conditions to our obligation to purchase the materials, such as quality or minimum output. Subject to satisfaction of those conditions, we will be obligated to purchase the materials at the cost determined by the purchase price mechanism. Based on the offtake agreements we have entered into thus far, the earliest date by which we could be obligated to purchase any output, subject to satisfaction of the applicable conditions, will be in 2024. \\n \\n Financial institutions participate in a supply chain finance SCF program that enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their Ford receivables (i.e., our payment obligations to the suppliers) to the financial institutions on a non-recourse basis in order to be paid earlier than our payment terms provide. Our suppliers voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms, the amounts we pay, or our liquidity. We have no economic interest in a supplier s decision to participate in the SCF program, and we have no direct financial relationship with the SCF financial institutions. Moreover, we do not provide any guarantees in connection with the SCF program. As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding amount of Ford receivables that suppliers elected to sell to the SCF financial institutions was 253 million. The amount settled through the SCF program during 2022 was 1.4 billion. \\n \\n 63 \\n\\nItem 7.

The year-over-year decrease was driven by a decrease in Ford Credit operating cash flow partially offset by favorable timing differences. Company adjusted free cash flow was 9.1 billion, 4.5 billion higher than a year ago, driven by higher Company adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit, timing benefits, improvement in working capital, and lower interest expense, offset partially by lower Ford Credit distributions. \\n \\n Capital spending was 6.5 billion in 2022, 0.3 billion higher than a year ago, and is expected to be in the range of 8 billion to 9 billion in 2023. \\n \\n The full year 2022 working capital impact was 0.2 billion positive, driven by higher payables. All other and timing differences were positive 1.9 billion. Timing differences include differences between accrual-based EBIT and the associated cash flows (e.g., pension and OPEB income or expense; compensation payments; marketing incentive and warranty payments to dealers). \\n \\n Shareholder distributions (including dividends and anti-dilutive share repurchases) were 2.5 billion in 2022. On February 2, 2023, we declared a regular dividend of 0.15 per share and a supplemental dividend of 0.65 per share. \\n \\n We previously announced our plan for the global redesign of our business, pursuant to which we are working to turn around automotive operations, compete like a challenger, and capitalize on our strengths by allocating more capital, more resources, and more talent to our strongest businesses and vehicle franchises. The cash effect related to our global redesign activities was 3.9 billion through December 31, 2022. \\n \\n 64 \\n\\nItem 7.

Total Company committed credit lines, excluding Ford Credit, at December 31, 2022 were 19.3 billion, consisting of 13.5 billion of our corporate credit facility, 2.0 billion of our supplemental revolving credit facility, 1.75 billion of our 364-day revolving credit facility, and 2.1 billion of local credit facilities. At December 31, 2022, the utilized portion of the corporate credit facility was 19 million, representing amounts utilized for letters of credit, and the full 1.75 billion of our 364-day revolving credit facility was utilized by Ford Credit, in its capacity as a subsidiary borrower under that facility. In addition, 1.7 billion of committed Company credit lines, excluding Ford Credit, was utilized under local credit facilities for our affiliates as of December 31, 2022. As of January 25, 2023, Ford Credit had repaid the full 1.75 billion outstanding under the 364-day revolving credit facility. \\n \\n Lenders under our corporate credit facility have 3.4 billion of commitments maturing on June 23, 2025 and 10.1 billion of commitments maturing on June 23, 2027. Lenders under our supplemental revolving credit facility have 0.1 billion of commitments maturing on September 29, 2024 and 1.9 billion of commitments maturing on June 23, 2025. Lenders under our 364-day revolving credit facility have 1.75 billion of commitments maturing on June 22, 2023. \\n \\n The corporate, supplemental, and 364-day credit agreements include certain sustainability-linked targets, pursuant to which the applicable margin and facility fees may be adjusted if Ford achieves, or fails to achieve, the specified targets related to global manufacturing facility greenhouse gas emissions, renewable electricity consumption, and Ford Europe CO 2 tailpipe emissions. Ford outperformed the 2021 targets for all three of the sustainability-linked metrics, which impacted pricing beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022. \\n \\n The corporate credit facility is unsecured and free of material adverse change conditions to borrowing, restrictive financial covenants (for example, interest or fixed-charge coverage ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and minimum net worth requirements), and credit rating triggers that could limit our ability to obtain funding or trigger early repayment. The corporate credit facility contains a liquidity covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum of 4 billion in aggregate of domestic cash, cash equivalents, and loaned and marketable securities and/or availability under the corporate credit facility, supplemental revolving credit facility, and 364-day revolving credit facility. The terms and conditions of the supplemental and 364-day revolving credit facilities are consistent with our corporate credit facility. Ford Credit has been designated as a subsidiary borrower under the corporate credit facility and the 364-day revolving credit facility. \\n \\n Each of the corporate credit facility, supplemental revolving credit facility, and 364-day revolving credit facility include a covenant that requires us to provide guarantees from certain of our subsidiaries in the event that our senior, unsecured, long-term debt does not maintain at least two investment grade ratings from Fitch, Moody s, and S P. The following subsidiaries have provided unsecured guarantees to the lenders under the credit facilities: Ford Component Sales, LLC; Ford European Holdings Inc.; Ford Global Technologies, LLC; Ford Holdings LLC (the parent company of Ford Credit); Ford International Capital LLC; Ford Mexico Holdings LLC; Ford Motor Service Company; Ford Next LLC; and Ford Trading Company, LLC. \\n \\n Debt. As shown in Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, at December 31, 2022, Company debt excluding Ford Credit was 19.9 billion. This balance is 400 million lower than at December 31, 2021, primarily reflecting the repayment in full of our 1.5 billion delayed draw term loan facility, repayment of the remaining 953 million under our Loan Arrangement and Reimbursement Agreement with the U.S. Department of Energy, a 1.1 billion redemption of higher coupon debt, and scheduled maturities, partially offset by the 750 million 903 million as of December 31, 2022) draw on our U.K. Export Finance term loan credit facility and the issuance of our 1.8 billion green bond and 600 million retail bond. \\n \\n Leverage. We manage Company debt (excluding Ford Credit) levels with a leverage framework that targets investment grade credit ratings through a normal business cycle. The leverage framework includes a ratio of total Company debt (excluding Ford Credit), underfunded pension liabilities, operating leases, and other adjustments, divided by Company adjusted EBIT (excluding Ford Credit EBT), and further adjusted to exclude depreciation and tooling amortization (excluding Ford Credit). \\n \\n Ford Credit s leverage is calculated as a separate business as described in the Liquidity - Ford Credit Segment section of Item 7. Ford Credit is self-funding and its debt, which is used to fund its operations, is separate from our Company debt excluding Ford Credit. \\n \\n 65 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Ford Credit Segment \\n \\n Ford Credit ended 2022 with 21 billion of liquidity. During the year, Ford Credit completed 16 billion of public term funding. \\n \\n Key elements of Ford Credit s funding strategy include: \\n \\n Maintain strong liquidity and funding diversity \\n Prudently access public markets \\n Continue growth of retail deposits in Europe \\n Flexibility to increase ABS mix as needed; preserving assets and committed capacity \\n Target financial statement leverage of 9:1 to 10:1 \\n Maintain self-liquidating balance sheet \\n \\n Ford Credit s liquidity profile continues to be diverse, robust, and focused on maintaining liquidity levels that meet its business and funding requirements. Ford Credit regularly stress tests its balance sheet and liquidity to ensure that it can continue to meet its financial obligations through economic cycles. \\n \\n Funding Sources. Ford Credit s funding sources include primarily unsecured debt and securitization transactions (including other structured financings). Ford Credit issues both short-term and long-term debt that is held by both institutional and retail investors, with long-term debt having an original maturity of more than 12 months. Ford Credit sponsors a number of securitization programs that can be structured to provide both short-term and long-term funding through institutional investors and other financial institutions in the United States and international capital markets. \\n \\n Ford Credit obtains unsecured funding from the sale of demand notes under its Ford Interest Advantage program and through the retail deposit programs at FCE Bank plc FCE and Ford Bank GmbH Ford Bank ). At December 31, 2022, the principal amount outstanding of Ford Interest Advantage notes, which may be redeemed at any time at the option of the holders thereof without restriction, and FCE and Ford Bank deposits was 14.3 billion. Ford Credit maintains multiple sources of readily available liquidity to fund the payment of its unsecured short-term debt obligations. \\n \\n The following table shows funding for Ford Credit s net receivables (in billions): December 31, 2020 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2022 Funding Structure Term unsecured debt 73.3 59.4 48.3 Term asset-backed securities 54.6 45.4 56.4 Ford Interest Advantage / Retail Deposits 9.8 12.9 14.3 Other (3.1) (0.2) 2.6 Equity 15.6 12.4 11.9 Adjustments for cash (18.5) (12.4) (11.2) Total Net Receivables 131.7 117.5 122.3 Securitized Funding as Percent of Total Debt 39.6 38.5 47.4 \\n \\n Net receivables of 122.3 billion at December 31, 2022 were funded primarily with term debt and term asset-backed securities.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Public Term Funding Plan. The following table shows Ford Credit s issuances for full year 2020, 2021, and 2022, and planned issuances for full year 2023, excluding short-term funding programs (in billions): \\n 2020 Actual 2021 Actual 2022 Actual 2023 Forecast Unsecured 14 5 6 10 - 13 Securitizations 13 9 10 10 - 13 Total public 27 14 16 20 - 26 \\n \\n In 2022, Ford Credit completed 16 billion of public term funding. For 2023, Ford Credit projects full year public term funding in the range of 20 billion to 26 billion. Through February 1, 2023, Ford Credit has completed 5 billion of public term issuances. \\n \\n Liquidity. The following table shows Ford Credit s liquidity sources and utilization (in billions): \\n December 31, 2020 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2022 Liquidity Sources (a) \\n Cash 18.5 12.4 11.2 Committed asset-backed facilities 38.1 37.1 37.4 Other unsecured credit facilities 2.5 2.7 2.3 Total liquidity sources 59.1 52.2 50.9 Utilization of Liquidity (a) \\n Securitization cash and restricted cash (3.9) (3.9) (2.9) Committed asset-backed facilities (16.7) (12.5) (26.6) Other unsecured credit facilities (0.5) (1.0) (0.8) Total utilization of liquidity (21.1) (17.4) (30.3) Gross liquidity 38.0 34.8 20.6 Asset-backed capacity in excess of eligible receivables and other adjustments (2.6) (2.8) 0.4 Net liquidity available for use 35.4 32.0 21.0 \\n __________ \\n (a) See Definitions and Information Regarding Ford Credit Causal Factors section. \\n \\n Ford Credit s net liquidity available for use will fluctuate quarterly based on factors including near-term debt maturities, receivable growth and decline, and timing of funding transactions. At December 31, 2022, Ford Credit s net liquidity available for use was 21 billion, 11 billion lower than year-end 2021. Ford Credit s net liquidity remains robust and aligns with lower near-term refinancing obligations. Ford Credit s sources of liquidity include cash, committed asset-backed facilities, and unsecured credit facilities. At December 31, 2022, Ford Credit s liquidity sources totaled 50.9 billion, down 1.3 billion from year-end 2021. Ford Credit continues to be well capitalized with a strong balance sheet. \\n \\n Material Cash Requirements. Ford Credit s material cash requirements include: (1) the purchase of retail financing and operating lease contracts from dealers and providing wholesale financing for dealers to finance new and used vehicles; and (2) debt repayments (for additional information on debt, see the Balance Sheet Liquidity Profile section below, the Material Cash Requirements section in Liquidity and Capital Resources - Company excluding Ford Credit above, and Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements). In addition, subject to approval by Ford Credit s Board of Directors, shareholder distributions may require the expenditure of a material amount of cash. Moreover, Ford Credit may be subject to additional material cash requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, e.g., legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions, and other matters. \\n \\n Ford Credit plans to utilize its liquidity (as described above) and its cash flows from business operations to fund its material cash requirements. \\n \\n 67 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Balance Sheet Liquidity Profile. Ford Credit defines its balance sheet liquidity profile as the cumulative maturities, including the impact of expected prepayments and allowance for credit losses, of its finance receivables, investment in operating leases, and cash, less the cumulative debt maturities over upcoming annual periods. Ford Credit s balance sheet is inherently liquid because of the short-term nature of its finance receivables, investment in operating leases, and cash. Ford Credit ensures its cumulative debt maturities have a longer tenor than its cumulative asset maturities. This positive maturity profile is intended to provide Ford Credit with additional liquidity after all of its assets have been funded and is in addition to liquidity available to protect for stress scenarios. \\n \\n The following table shows Ford Credit s cumulative maturities for assets and total debt for the periods presented and unsecured long-term debt maturities in the individual periods presented (in billions): \\n 2023 2024 2025 2026 and Beyond Balance Sheet Liquidity Profile Assets (a) 71 97 117 137 Total debt (b) 58 83 100 121 Memo: Unsecured long-term debt maturities 8 12 11 17 \\n __________ \\n (a) Includes gross finance receivables less the allowance for credit losses (including certain finance receivables that are reclassified in consolidation to Trade and other receivables ), investment in operating leases net of accumulated depreciation, cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding amounts related to insurance activities). Amounts shown include the impact of expected prepayments. \\n (b) Excludes unamortized debt (discount)/premium, unamortized issuance costs, and fair value adjustments. \\n \\n Maturities of investment in operating leases consist primarily of the portion of rental payments attributable to depreciation over the remaining life of the lease and the expected residual value at lease termination. Maturities of finance receivables and investment in operating leases in the table above include expected prepayments for Ford Credit s retail installment sale contracts and investment in operating leases. The table above also reflects adjustments to debt maturities to match the asset-backed debt maturities with the underlying asset maturities. \\n \\n All wholesale securitization transactions and wholesale receivables are shown maturing in the next 12 months, even if the maturities extend beyond 2023. The retail securitization transactions under certain committed asset-backed facilities are assumed to amortize immediately rather than amortizing after the expiration of the commitment period. As of December 31, 2022, Ford Credit had 137 billion of assets, 60 billion of which were unencumbered. \\n \\n Funding and Liquidity Risks. Ford Credit s funding plan is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control, including disruption in the capital markets that could impact both unsecured debt and asset-backed securities and the effects of regulatory changes on the financial markets. \\n \\n Despite Ford Credit s diverse sources of funding and liquidity, its ability to maintain liquidity may be affected by, among others, the following factors (not necessarily listed in order of importance or probability of occurrence): \\n \\n Prolonged disruption of the debt and securitization markets; \\n Global capital market volatility; \\n Credit ratings assigned to Ford and Ford Credit; \\n Market capacity for Ford- and Ford Credit-sponsored investments; \\n General demand for the type of securities Ford Credit offers; \\n Ford Credit s ability to continue funding through asset-backed financing structures; \\n Performance of the underlying assets within Ford Credit s asset-backed financing structures; \\n Inability to obtain hedging instruments; \\n Accounting and regulatory changes; and \\n Ford Credit s ability to maintain credit facilities and committed asset-backed facilities. \\n \\n Stress Tests. Ford Credit regularly conducts stress testing on its funding and liquidity sources to ensure it can continue to meet financial obligations and support the sale of Ford and Lincoln vehicles during firm-specific and market-wide stress events. Stress tests are intended to quantify the potential impact of various adverse scenarios on the balance sheet and liquidity. These scenarios include assumptions on access to unsecured and secured debt markets, runoff of short-term funding, and ability to renew expiring liquidity commitments and are measured over various time periods, including 30 days, 90 days, and longer term. Ford Credit s stress test does not assume any additional funding, liquidity, or capital support from Ford. Ford Credit routinely develops contingency funding plans as part of its liquidity stress testing. \\n 68 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Leverage. Ford Credit uses leverage, or the debt-to-equity ratio, to make various business decisions, including evaluating and establishing pricing for finance receivable and operating lease financing, and assessing its capital structure. \\n \\n The table below shows the calculation of Ford Credit s financial statement leverage (in billions): December 31, 2020 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2022 Leverage Calculation Debt 137.7 117.7 119.0 Equity (a) 15.6 12.4 11.9 Financial statement leverage (to 1) 8.8 9.5 10.0 \\n __________ \\n (a) Total shareholder s interest reported on Ford Credit s balance sheets. \\n \\n Ford Credit plans its leverage by considering market conditions and the risk characteristics of its business. At December 31, 2022, Ford Credit s financial statement leverage was 10:1. Ford Credit targets financial statement leverage in the range of 9:1 to 10:1. \\n 69 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Total Company \\n \\n Pension Plan Contributions and Strategy. Our strategy is to reduce the risk of our funded defined benefit pension plans, including minimizing the volatility of the value of our pension assets relative to pension liabilities and the need for unplanned use of capital resources to fund the plans. The strategy reduces balance sheet, cash flow, and income exposures and, in turn, reduces our risk profile. Going forward, we expect to: \\n \\n Limit our pension contributions to offset ongoing service cost or meet regulatory requirements, if any; \\n Minimize the volatility of the value of our pension assets relative to pension obligations and ensure assets are sufficient to pay plan benefits; and \\n Evaluate strategic actions to reduce pension liabilities, such as plan design changes, curtailments, or settlements \\n 2021 2022 2022 H / (L) 2021 Pension Funded Status B) \\n U.S. Plans 1.0 0.1 (0.9) Non-U.S. Plans (1.3) (0.3) 1.0 Total Global Pension (0.3) (0.2) 0.1 Year-End Discount Rate (Weighted Average) \\n U.S. Plans 2.91 5.51 2.60 ppts Non-U.S. Plans 1.75 4.42 2.67 ppts Actual Asset Returns U.S. Plans 2.82 (21.20) (24.02) ppts Non-U.S. Plans 2.69 (25.40) (28.09) ppts Pension - Funded Plans Only B) \\n Funded Status 5.8 4.1 (1.7) Contributions for Funded Plans 0.8 0.6 (0.2) \\n \\n Worldwide, our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by 0.2 billion at December 31, 2022, an improvement of 0.1 billion from December 31, 2021, primarily reflecting the impact of higher discount rates mostly offset by negative asset performance. Of the 0.2 billion underfunded status at year-end 2022, our funded plans were 4.1 billion overfunded and our unfunded plans were 4.3 billion underfunded. These unfunded plans are pay as you go with benefits paid from Company cash and primarily include certain plans in Germany and U.S. defined benefit plans for senior management. \\n \\n The fixed income mix was 79 in both our U.S. plans and non-U.S. plans at year-end 2022. \\n \\n In 2022, we contributed 567 million to our global funded pension plans, a decrease of 206 million compared with 2021. During 2023, we expect to contribute between 500 million and 600 million of cash to our global funded pension plans. We also expect to make about 400 million of benefit payments to participants in unfunded plans. Based on current assumptions and regulations, we do not expect to have a legal requirement to fund our major U.S. plans in 2023. Our global funded plans remain fully funded in aggregate, demonstrating the effectiveness of our de-risking strategy and our commitment to a strong balance sheet. \\n \\n For a detailed discussion of our pension plans, refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates - Pensions and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2022 Form 10-K Report and Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. \\n 70 \\n\\nItem 7.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n CREDIT RATINGS \\n \\n Our short-term and long-term debt is rated by four credit rating agencies designated as nationally recognized statistical rating organizations NRSROs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission: DBRS, Fitch, Moody s, and S P. \\n \\n In several markets, locally recognized rating agencies also rate us. A credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the credit risk associated with a corporate entity or particular securities issued by that entity. Rating agencies ratings of us are based on information provided by us and other sources. Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria for evaluating company risk and, therefore, ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. \\n \\n There have been no rating actions taken by these NRSROs since the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. \\n \\n The following table summarizes certain of the credit ratings and outlook presently assigned by these four NRSROs: NRSRO RATINGS Ford Ford Credit NRSROs Issuer Default / Corporate / Issuer Rating Long-Term Senior Unsecured Outlook / Trend Long-Term Senior Unsecured Short-Term Unsecured Outlook / Trend Minimum Long-Term Investment Grade Rating DBRS BB (high) BB (high) Positive BB (high) R-4 Positive BBB (low) Fitch BB+ BB+ Positive BB+ B Positive BBB- Moody s N/A Ba2 Stable Ba2 NP Stable Baa3 S P BB+ BB+ Positive BB+ B Positive BBB- \\n \\n 72 \\n\\nItem 7.

The guidance is based on our expectations as of February 2, 2023. Our actual results could differ materially from our guidance due to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including those set forth in Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I. 2023 Guidance Total Company Adjusted EBIT (a) 9 - 11 billion Adjusted Free Cash Flow (a) About 6 billion Capital spending 8 - 9 billion Ford Credit EBT About 1.3 billion \\n __________ \\n (a) When we provide guidance for Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted Free Cash Flow, we do not provide guidance for the most comparable GAAP measures because, as described in more detail below in Non-GAAP Measures That Supplement GAAP Measures, they include items that are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty. \\n\\nFor full-year 2023, we expect adjusted EBIT of 9 billion to 11 billion, which assumes a seasonally adjusted annual rate SAAR of about 15 million in the United States and about 13 million in Europe. We also expect adjusted free cash flow of about 6 billion, which assumes no distributions from Ford Credit. \\n \\n Our outlook for 2023 assumes the headwinds and tailwinds below. \\n \\n Headwinds: \\n An expected mild U.S. recession and a moderate recession in Europe \\n Higher incentives across the industry as supply and demand come back into balance \\n Ford Credit EBT of about 1.3 billion, down about 1.4 billion, reflecting unfavorable lease residuals and credit losses and the non-recurrence of derivative gains \\n Continuation of the strong dollar \\n About 2 billion lower past service pension income \\n Continued investments in growth, including in customer experience, connected services, and capital expenditures \\n \\n Tailwinds: \\n Improvement in the supply chain and industry volume \\n Launch of our all-new Super Duty \\n Lower cost of goods sold, including efficiencies in materials, commodities, logistics, and other parts of our industrial platform \\n \\n Additionally, we will be negotiating a new contract with the UAW in the United States. \\n \\n 73 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements \\n \\n Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations, forecasts, and assumptions by our management and involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: \\n \\n Ford and Ford Credit s financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by public health issues, including epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19; \\n Ford is highly dependent on its suppliers to deliver components in accordance with Ford s production schedule and specifications, and a shortage of or inability to acquire key components, such as semiconductors, or raw materials, such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, can disrupt Ford s production of vehicles; \\n To facilitate access to the raw materials necessary for the production of electric vehicles, Ford has entered into, and expects to continue to enter into, multi-year commitments to raw material suppliers that subject Ford to risks associated with lower future demand for such materials as well as costs that fluctuate and are difficult to accurately forecast; \\n Ford s long-term competitiveness depends on the successful execution of Ford+; \\n Ford s vehicles could be affected by defects that result in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, or increased warranty costs; \\n Ford may not realize the anticipated benefits of existing or pending strategic alliances, joint ventures, acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings, or new business strategies; \\n Operational systems, security systems, vehicles, and services could be affected by cyber incidents, ransomware attacks, and other disruptions and impact Ford and Ford Credit as well as their suppliers and dealers; \\n Ford s production, as well as Ford s suppliers production, and/or the ability to deliver products to consumers could be disrupted by labor issues, natural or man-made disasters, adverse effects of climate change, financial distress, production difficulties, capacity limitations, or other factors; \\n Ford s ability to maintain a competitive cost structure could be affected by labor or other constraints; \\n Ford s ability to attract and retain talented, diverse, and highly skilled employees is critical to its success and competitiveness; \\n Ford s new and existing products and digital, software, and physical services are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries and its reputation may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced; \\n Ford s results are dependent on sales of larger, more profitable vehicles, particularly in the United States; \\n With a global footprint, Ford s results could be adversely affected by economic or geopolitical developments, including protectionist trade policies such as tariffs, or other events; \\n Industry sales volume can be volatile and could decline if there is a financial crisis, recession, or significant geopolitical event; \\n Ford may face increased price competition or a reduction in demand for its products resulting from industry excess capacity, currency fluctuations, competitive actions, or other factors; \\n Inflationary pressure and fluctuations in commodity and energy prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and market value of Ford or Ford Credit s investments, including marketable securities, can have a significant effect on results; \\n Ford and Ford Credit s access to debt, securitization, or derivative markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts could be affected by credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, regulatory requirements, or other factors; \\n The impact of government incentives on Ford s business could be significant, and Ford s receipt of government incentives could be subject to reduction, termination, or clawback; \\n Ford Credit could experience higher-than-expected credit losses, lower-than-anticipated residual values, or higher-than-expected return volumes for leased vehicles; \\n Economic and demographic experience for pension and OPEB plans (e.g., discount rates or investment returns) could be worse than Ford has assumed; \\n Pension and other postretirement liabilities could adversely affect Ford s liquidity and financial condition; \\n Ford and Ford Credit could experience unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations, or adverse publicity arising out of alleged defects in products, services, perceived environmental impacts, or otherwise; \\n Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations; \\n Ford and Ford Credit could be affected by the continued development of more stringent privacy, data use, and data protection laws and regulations as well as consumers heightened expectations to safeguard their personal information; and \\n Ford Credit could be subject to new or increased credit regulations, consumer protection regulations, or other regulations. \\n \\n 74 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n We cannot be certain that any expectation, forecast, or assumption made in preparing forward-looking statements will prove accurate, or that any projection will be realized. It is to be expected that there may be differences between projected and actual results. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of their initial issuance, and we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. For additional discussion, see Item 1A. Risk Factors above. \\n 75 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT SUPPLEMENT GAAP MEASURES \\n \\n We use both generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for operational and financial decision making, and to assess Company and segment business performance. The non-GAAP measures listed below are intended to be considered by users as supplemental information to their equivalent GAAP measures, to aid investors in better understanding our financial results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful perspective on underlying operating results and trends, and a means to compare our period-over-period results. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in items or events being adjusted. \\n \\n Company Adjusted EBIT (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Income/(Loss) Attributable to Ford) Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) excludes interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), taxes, and pre-tax special items. This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it focuses on underlying operating results and trends, and improves comparability of our period-over-period results. Our management ordinarily excludes special items from its review of the results of the operating segments for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources. Our categories of pre-tax special items and the applicable significance guideline for each item (which may consist of a group of items related to a single event or action) are as follows: \\n \\n Pre-Tax Special Item Significance Guideline Pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses No minimum Gains and losses on investments in equity securities No minimum Personnel expenses, dealer-related costs, and facility-related charges stemming from our efforts to match production capacity and cost structure to market demand and changing model mix \\n Generally 100 million or more Other items that we do not necessarily consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities 500 million or more for individual field service actions; generally 100 million or more for other items \\n \\n When we provide guidance for adjusted EBIT, we do not provide guidance on a net income basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty, including gains and losses on pension and OPEB remeasurements and on investments in equity securities. \\n \\n Company Adjusted EBIT Margin (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Company Net Income/(Loss) Margin) Company Adjusted EBIT margin is Company adjusted EBIT divided by Company revenue. This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it allows users to evaluate our operating results aligned with industry reporting. \\n \\n Adjusted Earnings/(Loss) Per Share (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Earnings/(Loss) Per Share) Measure of Company s diluted net earnings/(loss) per share adjusted for impact of pre-tax special items (described above), tax special items, and restructuring impacts in noncontrolling interests. The measure provides investors with useful information to evaluate performance of our business excluding items not indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities. When we provide guidance for adjusted earnings/(loss) per share, we do not provide guidance on an earnings/(loss) per share basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses. \\n \\n Adjusted Effective Tax Rate (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Effective Tax Rate) Measure of Company s tax rate excluding pre-tax special items (described above) and tax special items. The measure provides an ongoing effective rate which investors find useful for historical comparisons and for forecasting. When we provide guidance for adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide guidance on an effective tax rate basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses. \\n 76 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Company Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Cash Provided By/(Used In) Operating Activities) Measure of Company s operating cash flow excluding Ford Credit s operating cash flows. The measure contains elements management considers operating activities, including Company excluding Ford Credit capital spending, Ford Credit distributions to its parent, and settlement of derivatives. The measure excludes cash outflows for funded pension contributions, global redesign (including separations), and other items that are considered operating cash flows under U.S. GAAP. This measure is useful to management and investors because it is consistent with management s assessment of the Company s operating cash flow performance. When we provide guidance for Company adjusted free cash flow, we do not provide guidance for net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities because the GAAP measure will include items that are difficult to quantify or predict with reasonable certainty, including cash flows related to the Company's exposures to foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices (separate from any related hedges), Ford Credit's operating cash flows, and cash flows related to special items, including separation payments, each of which individually or in the aggregate could have a significant impact to our net cash provided by/(used in) our operating activities. \\n \\n Adjusted ROIC Calculated as the sum of adjusted net operating profit/(loss) after cash tax from the last four quarters, divided by the average invested capital over the last four quarters. Adjusted Return on Invested Capital Adjusted ROIC provides management and investors with useful information to evaluate the Company s after-cash tax operating return on its invested capital for the period presented. Adjusted net operating profit/(loss) after cash tax measures operating results less special items, interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), and certain pension/OPEB costs. Average invested capital is the sum of average balance sheet equity, debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), and net pension/OPEB liability. \\n 77 \\n\\nItem 7.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \\n\\nWe consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. \\n \\n Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. \\n \\n Warranties and Field Service Actions \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required. We provide base warranties on the products we sell for specific periods of time and/or mileage, which vary depending upon the type of product and the geographic location of its sale. Separately, we also periodically perform field service actions related to safety recalls, emission recalls, and other product campaigns. Pursuant to these warranties and field service actions, we will repair, replace, or adjust parts on a vehicle that are defective in factory-supplied materials or workmanship. We accrue the estimated cost of both base warranty coverages and field service actions at the time of sale. In addition, from time to time, we issue extended warranties at our expense, the estimated cost of which is accrued at the time of issuance. \\n \\n Assumptions and Approach Used. We establish our estimate of base warranty obligations using a patterned estimation model. We use historical information regarding the nature, frequency, and average cost of claims for each vehicle line by model year. We reevaluate our estimate of base warranty obligations on a regular basis. Experience has shown that initial data for any given model year may be volatile; therefore, our process relies on long-term historical averages until sufficient data are available. With actual experience, we use the data to update the historical averages. We then compare the resulting accruals with present spending rates to assess whether the balances are adequate to meet expected future obligations. Based on this data, we update our estimates as necessary. \\n \\n Field service actions may occur in periods beyond the base warranty coverage period. We establish our estimates of field service action obligations using a patterned estimation model. We use historical information regarding the nature, frequency, severity, and average cost of claims for each model year. We assess our obligation for field service actions on a regular basis using actual claims experience and update our estimates as necessary. \\n \\n Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors used in establishing our estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 25 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for information regarding warranty and field service action costs. \\n \\n Pensions and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required. The estimation of our defined benefit pension and OPEB plan obligations and expenses requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events, such as demographic experience and health care cost increases. Plan obligations and expenses are based on existing retirement plan provisions. No assumption is made regarding any potential future changes to benefit provisions beyond those to which we are presently committed (e.g., in existing labor contracts). \\n 84 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Assumptions and Approach Used. The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: \\n \\n Discount rates. Our discount rate assumptions are based primarily on the results of cash flow matching analyses, which match the future cash outflows for each major plan to a yield curve based on high-quality bonds specific to the country of the plan. Benefit payments are discounted at the rates on the curve to determine the year-end obligations. \\n \\n Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Our expected long-term rate of return considers inputs from a range of advisors for capital market returns, inflation, bond yields, and other variables, adjusted for specific aspects of our investment strategy by plan. Historical returns also are considered when appropriate. The assumption is based on consideration of all inputs, with a focus on long-term trends to avoid short-term market influences. \\n \\n Salary growth. Our salary growth assumption reflects our actual experience, long-term outlook, and assumed inflation. \\n \\n Inflation. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators, including real gross domestic product growth and central bank inflation targets. \\n \\n Expected contributions. Our expected amount and timing of contributions are based on an assessment of minimum requirements, cash availability, and other considerations (e.g., funded status, avoidance of regulatory premiums and levies, and tax efficiency). \\n \\n Retirement rates. Retirement rates are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience. \\n \\n Mortality rates. Mortality rates are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience. \\n \\n Health care cost trends . Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook, and an assessment of likely long-term trends. \\n \\n Assumptions are set at each year-end and are generally not changed during the year unless there is a major plan event, such as a curtailment or settlement that would trigger a plan remeasurement. \\n \\n See Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding pension and OPEB costs and assumptions. \\n \\n Pension Plans \\n \\n Effect of Actual Results . The year-end 2022 weighted average discount rate was 5.51 for U.S. plans and 4.42 for non-U.S. plans, reflecting increases of 260 and 267 basis points, respectively, compared with year-end 2021. In 2022, the U.S. actual return on assets was negative 21.20 , which was lower than the expected long-term rate of return of 5.75 . Non-U.S. actual return on assets was negative 25.40 , which was lower than the expected long-term rate of return of 3.29 . The lower returns are explained by losses on fixed income and growth assets, both of which were consistent with broader market performance. In total, higher rates and pension asset losses, in addition to demographic and other updates, resulted in a net remeasurement loss of 1.3 billion, which has been recognized within net periodic benefit cost and reported as a special item. \\n \\n For 2023, the expected long-term rate of return on assets is 6.25 for U.S. plans, up 50 basis points from 2022, and 4.13 for non-U.S. plans, up 84 basis points compared with a year ago, reflecting higher nominal risk-free rates and a higher consensus on capital market return expectations from advisors. \\n \\n De-risking Strategy . We employ a broad de-risking strategy for our global funded plans that increases the matching characteristics of our assets relative to our obligation as funded status improves. Changes in interest rates, which directly influence changes in discount rates, in addition to other factors have a significant impact on the value of our pension obligation and fixed income asset portfolio. Our de-risking strategy has increased the allocation to fixed income investments and reduced our funded status sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates should result in offsetting effects in the value of our pension obligation and the value of the fixed income asset portfolio. \\n 85 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Sensitivity Analysis. The December 31, 2022 pension funded status and 2023 expense are affected by year-end 2022 assumptions. Sensitivities to these assumptions may be asymmetric and are specific to the time periods noted. The effects of changes in the factors that generally have the largest impact on year-end funded status and pension expense are discussed below. \\n \\n Discount rates and interest rates have the largest impact on our obligations and fixed income assets. The table below estimates the effect on our funded status of an increase/decrease in discount rates and interest rates (in millions): Basis Point Change Increase/(Decrease) in December 31, 2022 Funded Status Factor U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans Discount rate - obligation +/- 100 bps 2,700/ (3,200) 2,500/ (3,100) Interest rate - fixed income assets +/- 100 (2,600)/3,100 (1,700)/2,000 Net impact on funded status 100/ (100) 800/ (1,100) \\n \\n The fixed income asset sensitivity shown excludes other fixed income return components (e.g., changes in credit spreads, bond coupon and active management excess returns), and growth asset returns. Other factors that affect net funded status (e.g., contributions) are not reflected. \\n \\n Interest rates and the expected long-term rate of return on assets have the largest effect on pension expense. These assumptions are generally set at each year-end for expense recorded throughout the following year. The table below estimates the effect on pension expense of a higher/lower assumption for these factors (in millions): Basis Point Change Increase/(Decrease) in 2023 Pension Expense Factor U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans Interest rate - service cost and interest cost +/- 25 bps 25/ (25) 10/ (10) Expected long-term rate of return on assets +/- 25 (80)/80 (50)/50 \\n \\n The effect of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities. The sensitivity of pension expense to a change in discount rate assumptions may not be linear. \\n \\n Other Postretirement Employee Benefits \\n \\n Effect of Actual Results . The weighted average discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation for worldwide OPEB plans at December 31, 2022 was 5.48 , compared with 2.97 at December 31, 2021, resulting in a worldwide net remeasurement gain of 1.3 billion, which has been recognized within net periodic benefit cost and reported as a special item. \\n \\n Sensitivity Analysis. Discount rates and interest rates have the largest effect on our OPEB obligation and expense. The table below estimates the effect on 2023 OPEB expense of higher/lower assumptions for these factors (in millions): Worldwide OPEB Basis Point Change (Increase)/Decrease 2022 YE Obligation Increase/(Decrease) 2023 Expense Factor Discount rate - obligation +/- 100 bps 415/ (495) N/A Interest rate - service cost and interest cost +/- 25 N/A 5/ (5) \\n \\n Income Taxes \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required. We must make estimates and apply judgment in determining the provision for income taxes for financial reporting purposes. We make these estimates and judgments primarily in the following areas: (i) the calculation of tax credits, (ii) the calculation of differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax reporting and financial statement purposes, as well as (iii) the calculation of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Changes in these estimates and judgments may result in a material increase or decrease to our tax provision, which would be recorded in the period in which the change occurs. \\n 86 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Assumptions and Approach Used. We are subject to the income tax laws and regulations of the many jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws and regulations are complex and involve uncertainties in the application to our facts and circumstances that may be open to interpretation. We recognize benefits for these uncertain tax positions based upon a process that requires judgment regarding the technical application of the laws, regulations, and various related judicial opinions. If, in our judgment, it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50 that the uncertain tax position will be settled favorably for us, we estimate an amount that ultimately will be realized. This process is inherently subjective since it requires our assessment of the probability of future outcomes. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis, including consideration of changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial opinions, as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. Changes to our estimate of the amount to be realized are recorded in our provision for income taxes during the period in which the change occurred. \\n \\n We must also assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income and reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized. \\n \\n This assessment, which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis, takes into account various types of evidence, including the following: \\n \\n Nature, frequency, and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses. A pattern of objectively measured recent financial reporting losses is heavily weighted as a source of negative evidence. We generally consider cumulative pre-tax losses in the three-year period ending with the current quarter to be significant negative evidence regarding future profitability. We also consider the strength and trend of earnings, as well as other relevant factors. In certain circumstances, historical information may not be as relevant due to changes in our business operations; \\n \\n Sources of future taxable income. Future reversals of existing temporary differences are heavily weighted sources of objectively verifiable positive evidence. Projections of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences are a source of positive evidence only when the projections are combined with a history of recent profits and can be reasonably estimated. Otherwise, these projections are considered inherently subjective and generally will not be sufficient to overcome negative evidence that includes relevant cumulative losses in recent years, particularly if the projected future taxable income is dependent on an anticipated turnaround to profitability that has not yet been achieved. In such cases, we generally give these projections of future taxable income no weight for the purposes of our valuation allowance assessment; and \\n \\n Tax planning strategies. If necessary and available, tax planning strategies could be implemented to accelerate taxable amounts to utilize expiring carryforwards. These strategies would be a source of additional positive evidence and, depending on their nature, could be heavily weighted. \\n \\n In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider the trade-offs between cash preservation and cash outlays to preserve tax credits. During 2022, we reversed 405 million of U.S. valuation allowances primarily as a result of planning actions. We presently believe that global valuation allowances of 822 million are required and that we ultimately will recover the remaining 14 billion of deferred tax assets. However, the ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets is subject to a number of variables, including our future profitability within relevant tax jurisdictions, and future tax planning and the related effects on our cash and liquidity position. Accordingly, our valuation allowances may increase or decrease in future periods. \\n \\n For additional information regarding income taxes, see Note 7 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. \\n 87 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Impairment of Long-Lived Assets \\n \\n Asset groups are tested at the level of the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Our asset groups presently are the regional Automotive business units (i.e., North America, South America, Europe, China (including Taiwan), and the International Markets Group), Ford Credit, and the separate legal entities within the Mobility segment. Asset groupings for impairment analysis are reevaluated when events occur, such as changes in organizational structure and management reporting. As a result of the new organizational and segment structure that will be implemented in 2023, our asset groups are expected to be Ford Blue North America, Ford Blue Europe, Ford Blue Rest of World, Ford Model e, Ford Pro, Ford Credit, and Ford Next (formerly Mobility). \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required - Held-and-Used Long-Lived Assets. We test our long-lived asset groups when changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable. Events that trigger a test for recoverability include material adverse changes in projected revenues or expenses, present cash flow losses combined with a history of cash flow losses and a forecast that demonstrates significant continuing losses, significant negative industry or economic trends (including a substantial shift in consumer preference), a current expectation that a long-lived asset group will be disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life, a significant adverse change in the manner in which an asset group is used or in its physical condition, or when there is a change in the asset grouping. In addition, investing in new, emerging products (e.g., EVs) or services (e.g., connectivity) may require substantial upfront investment, which may result in initial forecasted negative cash flows in the near term. In these instances, near term negative cash flows on their own may not be indicative of a triggering event for evaluation of impairment. In such circumstances we also conduct a qualitative evaluation of the business growth trajectory, which includes updating our assessment of when positive cash flows are expected to be generated, confirming whether established milestones are being achieved, and assessing our ability and intent to continue to access required funding to execute the plan. If this evaluation indicates a triggering event has occurred, a test for recoverability is performed. \\n \\n When a triggering event occurs, a test for recoverability is performed, comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group. If the undiscounted forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, the asset group s fair value is measured relying primarily on a discounted cash flow method. To the extent available, we will also consider third-party valuations of our long-lived assets that were prepared for other business purposes. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value. When an impairment loss is recognized for assets to be held and used, the adjusted carrying amounts of those assets are depreciated over their remaining useful life. \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required - Held-for-Sale Operations. We perform an impairment test on a disposal group to be discontinued, held for sale, or otherwise disposed of when we have committed to an action and the action is expected to be completed within one year. We estimate fair value to approximate the expected proceeds to be received less cost to sell and compare it to the carrying value of the disposal group. An impairment charge is recognized when the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. \\n \\n Assumptions and Approach Used - Held-and-Used Long-Lived Assets. Fair value of an asset group is determined from the perspective of a market-participant considering, among other things, appropriate discount rates, valuation techniques, the most advantageous market, and assumptions about the highest and best use of the asset group. \\n \\n We measure the fair value of an asset group based on market prices (i.e., the amount for which the asset could be sold to a third party) when available. When market prices are not available, we generally estimate the fair value of the asset group using the income approach and/or the market approach. The income approach uses cash flow projections. Inherent in our development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results, business plan forecasts, expected growth rates, and cost of capital, similar to those a market participant would use to assess fair value. We also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions and other data. Many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management, and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods. \\n \\n Changes in assumptions or estimates can materially affect the fair value measurement of an asset group and, therefore, can affect the test results. The following are key assumptions we use in making cash flow projections: \\n \\n Business projections. We make assumptions about the demand for our products in the marketplace. These \\n assumptions drive our planning assumptions for volume, mix, and pricing. We also make assumptions about our cost levels (e.g., capacity utilization, cost performance). These projections are derived using our internal business plan forecasts that are updated at least annually and reviewed by our Board of Directors. \\n 88 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Long-term growth rate. A growth rate is used to calculate the terminal value of the business and is added to the present value of the debt-free interim cash flows. The growth rate is the expected rate at which an asset group s business unit s earnings stream is projected to grow beyond the planning period. \\n \\n Discount rate. When measuring possible impairment, future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted-average cost of capital that we anticipate a potential market participant would use. Weighted-average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall risk-adjusted pre-tax rate of return expected by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise. \\n \\n Economic projections. Assumptions regarding general economic conditions are included in and affect our assumptions regarding industry sales and pricing estimates for our vehicles. These macroeconomic assumptions include, but are not limited to, industry sales volumes, inflation, interest rates, prices of raw materials (e.g., commodities), and foreign currency exchange rates. \\n \\n The market approach is another method for measuring the fair value of a reporting unit or asset group. This approach relies on the market value (i.e., market capitalization) of companies that are engaged in the same or similar line of business as the reporting unit or asset group being evaluated. In addition, to the extent available we also consider third-party valuations that were prepared for other business purposes. \\n \\n During 2022, we continued to progress our global redesign. Against this backdrop, we determined that there were triggering events related to our South America and International Markets Group IMG business units. We also assessed our expected new 2023 asset groups, which consist of Ford Blue North America, Ford Blue Europe, Ford Blue Rest of World, Ford Model e, Ford Pro, Ford Credit and Ford Next and assessed these groups for triggering events and potential impairment. We determined that the carrying values of the long-lived assets were recoverable at December 31, 2022 under our existing assets groups as well as under our anticipated 2023 asset groups. If in future quarters our economic or business projections were to change as a result of our plans or changes in the economic or business environment, there was a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used, or there was a current expectation that a long-lived asset group will be disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life, we would undertake additional testing, as appropriate, which could result in an impairment of long-lived assets. \\n \\n Assumptions and Approach Used - Held-for-Sale Operations . In the third quarter of 2022, we entered into an agreement to sell our Sanand, India vehicle assembly and powertrain plants to Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Limited Tata ). The sale transaction included the land, buildings, and other fixed assets (excluding the powertrain machinery and equipment) for the plants. Accordingly, we have reported 88 million of fixed assets for this operation as held for sale for the period ended December 31, 2022. We recognized pre-tax impairment charges in Cost of sales of 32 million in the third quarter of 2022 to adjust the carrying value of the held-for-sale assets to fair value less costs to sell. We determined fair value using the market approach, estimated based on the negotiated value of the assets. On January 10, 2023, we completed the sale of the plants to Tata. See Note 22 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding held-for-sale operations. \\n\\nAllowance for Credit Losses \\n \\n The allowance for credit losses represents Ford Credit s estimate of the expected lifetime credit losses inherent in finance receivables as of the balance sheet date. The adequacy of Ford Credit s allowance for credit losses is assessed quarterly, and the assumptions and models used in establishing the allowance are evaluated regularly. Because credit losses can vary substantially over time, estimating credit losses requires a number of assumptions about matters that are uncertain. Changes in assumptions affect Ford Credit interest, operating, and other expenses on our consolidated income statements and the allowance for credit losses contained within Ford Credit finance receivables, net on our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding allowance for credit losses. \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required. Ford Credit estimates the allowance for credit losses for receivables that share similar risk characteristics based on a collective assessment using a combination of measurement models and management judgment. The models consider factors such as historical trends in credit losses, recent portfolio performance, and forward-looking macroeconomic conditions. The models vary by portfolio and receivable type including consumer finance receivables, wholesale loans, and dealer loans. If Ford Credit does not believe the models reflect lifetime expected credit losses for the portfolio, an adjustment is made to reflect management judgment regarding qualitative factors including economic uncertainty, observable changes in portfolio performance, and other relevant factors. \\n\\n89 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Assumptions Used. Ford Credit s allowance for credit losses is based on its assumptions regarding: \\n \\n Probability of default . The expected probability of payment and time to default, which include assumptions about macroeconomic factors and recent performance; and \\n Loss given default. The percentage of the expected balance due at default that is not recoverable. The loss given default takes into account expected collateral value and future recoveries. \\n \\n Macroeconomic factors used in Ford Credit s models are country specific and include variables such as unemployment rates, personal bankruptcy filings, housing prices, and gross domestic product. \\n \\n Sensitivity Analysis. Changes in the probability of default and loss given default assumptions would affect the allowance for credit losses. The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions for Ford Credit s U.S. Ford and Lincoln retail financing is as follows (in millions): Assumption Basis Point Change \\n Increase/(Decrease) Probability of default (lifetime) +/- 100 bps 210/ (210) Loss given default +/- 100 10/(10) \\n \\n Accumulated Depreciation on Vehicles Subject to Operating Leases \\n \\n Accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases reduces the value of the leased vehicles in Ford Credit s operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their expected residual value at the end of the lease term. \\n \\n Ford Credit monitors residual values each month, and it reviews the adequacy of accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis. If Ford Credit believes that the expected residual values for its vehicles have changed, it revises depreciation to ensure that net investment in operating leases (equal to the acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation) will be adjusted to reflect Ford Credit s revised estimate of the expected residual value at the end of the lease term. Adjustments to depreciation expense result in a change in the depreciation rates of the vehicles subject to operating leases and are recorded prospectively on a straight-line basis. \\n \\n Generally, lease customers have the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer. \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required. Each operating lease in Ford Credit s portfolio represents a vehicle it owns that has been leased to a customer. At the time Ford Credit purchases a lease, it establishes an expected residual value for the vehicle. Ford Credit estimates the expected residual value by evaluating recent auction values, return volumes for its leased vehicles, industrywide used vehicle prices, marketing incentive plans, and vehicle quality data. \\n \\n Assumptions Used. Ford Credit s accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases is based on assumptions regarding: \\n \\n Auction value. Ford Credit s projection of the market value of the vehicles when sold at the end of the lease; and \\n Return volume. Ford Credit s projection of the number of vehicles that will be returned at lease-end. \\n \\n See Note 12 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases. \\n\\n90 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Sensitivity Analysis. For returned vehicles, Ford Credit faces a risk that the amount it obtains from the vehicle sold at auction will be less than its estimate of the expected residual value for the vehicle. The impact of the change in assumptions on future auction values and return volumes would increase or decrease accumulated supplemental depreciation and depreciation expense over the remaining terms of the operating leases; however, the impact may be tempered or exacerbated based on future auction values in relation to the purchase price specified in the lease contract. A change in the assumption for an auction value will impact Ford Credit s estimate of accumulated supplemental depreciation if the future auction value is lower than the purchase price specified in the lease contract. The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions for Ford Credit s U.S. Ford and Lincoln operating lease portfolio is as follows (in millions): Assumption Basis Point \\n Change \\n Increase/(Decrease) Future auction values +/- 100 bps (10)/ 10 Return volumes +/- 100 5/(5) \\n \\n Adjustments to the amount of accumulated supplemental depreciation on operating leases are reflected on our balance sheets as Net investment in operating leases and on our income statements in Ford Credit interest, operating, and other expenses. \\n 91 \\n\\nItem 7.

                                                                                                                            ITEM 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \\n\\nKey Trends and Economic Factors Affecting Ford and the Automotive Industry \\n \\n Production and Supply Chain. Although we saw improvements in our supply chain throughout 2023, including easing of the semiconductor shortage, we continue to face some production issues due to, among other things, labor shortages at our suppliers. Moreover, we have received and continue to receive claims from our supply base related to inflationary pressure and production disruption. Upon receipt, we evaluate those claims, and, in certain circumstances, in order to ensure continuity of supply and mitigate the impact on our production, have made payments to our suppliers, sometimes under duress. We continue to reevaluate our supply base and sourcing decisions and may in the future incur charges to improve flexibility and cost competitiveness. \\n \\n Currency Exchange Rate Volatility. Globally, central banks have begun shifting from tightening policy by raising interest rates to holding rates steady or, in some markets, beginning to cut rates. As they do, they need to carefully balance the risk that inflation remains elevated against the heightened financial and economic risks associated with high interest rates. This is notable for many emerging markets, which may also face increased exposure to commodity prices and political instability, contributing to unpredictable movements in the value of their exchange rates. In addition to direct impacts on the financial flows of global automotive companies, currency movements can also impact pricing of vehicles exported to overseas markets. In most markets, exchange rates are market-determined, and all are impacted by many different macroeconomic and policy factors, and thus likely to remain volatile. However, in some markets, exchange rates are heavily influenced or controlled by governments. \\n \\n Pricing Pressure. Despite vehicle pricing remaining elevated over the last year due to strong demand, supply shortages, and inflationary costs, we have already observed moderation in the rate of new and used vehicle price increases as auto production recovers from the semiconductor shortage, but it is unclear whether prices will decline fully to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. Over the long term, intense competition and excess capacity are likely to put downward pressure on inflation-adjusted prices for similarly-contented vehicles and contribute to a challenging pricing environment for the automotive industry in most major markets. \\n \\n Electric Vehicle Market. Although we continue to invest in our electric vehicle strategy, we have observed lower-than-anticipated industrywide electric vehicle adoption rates and near-term pricing pressures, which has led us and may in the future lead us to adjust our spending, production, and/or product launches to better match the pace of electric vehicle adoption. As a result of the lower-than-anticipated adoption rates, near-term pricing pressures, and other factors, we recorded about 0.7 billion of charges in 2023 and may continue to incur charges, which could be substantial, related to payments to our electric vehicle-related suppliers (battery, raw material, or otherwise), inventory adjustments, or other matters. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional discussion of the risks related to lower-than-anticipated electric vehicle volumes and our planned transition to a greater mix of electric vehicles. \\n \\n Commodity and Energy Prices. Prices for commodities remain volatile. In some cases, spot prices for various commodities have recently diverged somewhat, as anticipated weakening in global industrial activity mitigates price increases for base metals such as steel and aluminum, while precious metals (e.g., palladium), and raw materials that are used in batteries for electric vehicles (e.g., lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, among other materials, for batteries) remain elevated. The net impact on us and our suppliers has been higher material costs overall. To help ensure supply of raw materials for critical components (e.g., batteries), we, like others in the industry, have entered into multi-year sourcing agreements and may enter into additional agreements. Similar dynamics are impacting energy markets, with Europe particularly exposed to the risk of both higher prices and constraints on supply of natural gas due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Such shortages may impact facilities operated by us or our suppliers, which could have an impact on us in Europe and other regions. In the long term, the outcome of de-carbonization and electrification of the vehicle fleet may depress oil demand, but the global energy transition will also contribute to ongoing volatility of oil and other energy prices. \\n \\n Vehicle Profitability. Our financial results depend on the profitability of the vehicles we sell, which may vary significantly by vehicle line. In general, larger vehicles tend to command higher prices and be more profitable than smaller vehicles. For example, in Ford Blue, our larger, more profitable vehicles had an average contribution margin that was 139 of our total average contribution margin across all vehicles, whereas our smaller vehicles had significantly lower contribution margins. In addition, government regulations aimed at reducing emissions and increasing fuel efficiency (e.g., ZEV mandates and low emission zones), and other factors that accelerate the transition to electrified vehicles, may increase the cost of vehicles by more than the perceived benefit to consumers and dampen margins. \\n\\n40 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Trade Policy. To the extent governments in various regions implement or intensify barriers to imports, such as erecting tariff or non-tariff barriers or manipulating their currency, and provide advantages to local exporters selling into the global marketplace, there can be a significant negative impact on manufacturers based in other markets. While we believe the long-term trend will support the growth of free trade, we will continue to monitor and address the developing role that geopolitical, climate, and labor concerns are playing in trade relations. \\n \\n Inflation and Interest Rates. We continue to see near-term impacts on our business due to inflation, including ongoing global price pressures in the wake of geopolitical volatility, driving up energy prices, freight premiums, and other operating costs above normal rates. Although headline inflation in the United States and Europe appears to have peaked, as gasoline and natural gas prices recede from the latest spike, core inflation (excluding food and energy prices) remains elevated and is a source of continued cost pressure on businesses and households. Interest rates have increased significantly as central banks in developed countries attempt to subdue inflation while government deficits and debt remain at high levels in many global markets. Accordingly, the eventual implications of higher government deficits and debt, tighter monetary policy, and potentially higher long-term interest rates may drive a higher cost of capital for the business. At Ford Credit, rising interest rates may impact its ability to source funding and offer financing at competitive rates, which could reduce its financing margin. \\n \\n Revenue \\n \\n Company excluding Ford Credit revenue is generated primarily by sales of vehicles, parts, accessories, and services from our Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro segments. Revenue is recorded when control is transferred to our customers (generally, our dealers and distributors). For the majority of sales, this occurs when products are shipped from our manufacturing facilities. However, we defer a portion of the consideration received when there is a separate future or stand-ready performance obligation, such as extended service contracts or ongoing vehicle connectivity. Revenue related to extended service contracts is recognized over the term of the agreement in proportion to the costs we expect to incur in satisfying the contract obligations; revenue related to other future or stand-ready performance obligations is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the period in which services are expected to be performed. Vehicles sold to daily rental car companies with an obligation to repurchase at an agreed upon amount, exercisable at the option of the customer, are accounted for as operating leases, with lease revenue recognized over the term of the lease. Proceeds from the sale of vehicles at auction are recognized in revenue upon transfer of control of the vehicle to the buyer. \\n \\n Most of the vehicles sold by us to our dealers and distributors are financed at wholesale by Ford Credit. Upon Ford Credit originating the wholesale receivable related to a dealer s purchase of a vehicle, Ford Credit pays cash to the relevant Ford entity in payment of the dealer s obligation for the purchase price of the vehicle. The dealer then pays the wholesale finance receivable to Ford Credit when it sells the vehicle to a retail customer. \\n \\n Our Ford Credit segment revenue is generated primarily from interest on finance receivables and revenue from operating leases. Revenue from interest on finance receivables is recognized over the term of the receivable using the interest method and includes the amortization of certain deferred origination costs. Revenue from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. \\n \\n Transactions between Ford Credit and our other segments occur in the ordinary course of business. For example, we offer special retail financing and lease incentives to dealers customers who choose to finance or lease our vehicles from Ford Credit. The cost for these incentives is included in our estimate of variable consideration at the date the related vehicle sales to our dealers are recorded. In order to compensate Ford Credit for the lower interest or lease payments offered to the retail customer, we pay the discounted value of the incentive directly to Ford Credit when it originates the retail finance or lease contract with the dealer s customer. Ford Credit recognizes the incentive amount over the life of retail finance contracts as an element of financing revenue and over the life of lease contracts as a reduction to depreciation. See Note 1 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of transactions between Ford Credit and our other segments. \\n\\n41 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Costs and Expenses \\n \\n Our income statement classifies our Company excluding Ford Credit total costs and expenses into two categories: (i) cost of sales, and (ii) selling, administrative, and other expenses. We include within cost of sales those costs related to the development, production, and distribution of our vehicles, parts, accessories, and services. Specifically, we include in cost of sales each of the following: material costs (including commodity costs); freight costs; warranty, including product recall costs; labor and other costs related to the development and production of our vehicles and connectivity, parts, accessories, and services; depreciation and amortization; and other associated costs. We include within selling, administrative, and other expenses labor and other costs not directly related to the development and production of our vehicles, parts, accessories, and services, including such expenses as advertising and sales promotion costs. \\n \\n Certain of our costs, such as material costs, generally vary directly with changes in volume and mix of production. In our industry, production volume often varies significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. Quarterly production volumes experience seasonal shifts throughout the year (including peak retail sales seasons and the impact on production of model changeover and new product launches). Annual production volumes are heavily impacted by external economic factors, including the pace of economic growth and factors such as the availability of consumer credit and cost of fuel. \\n \\n As a result, we analyze the profit impact of certain cost changes holding constant present-year volume and mix and currency exchange, in order to evaluate our cost trends absent the impact of varying production and currency exchange levels. We analyze these cost changes in the following categories: \\n \\n Contribution Costs these costs typically vary with production volume. These costs include material (including commodity), warranty, and freight and duty costs. \\n \\n Structural Costs these costs typically do not have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume. These costs include manufacturing; vehicle and software engineering; spending-related; advertising and sales promotion; administrative, information technology, and selling; and pension and OPEB costs. \\n \\n While contribution costs generally vary directly in proportion to production volume, elements within our structural costs category are impacted to differing degrees by changes in production volume. We also have varying degrees of discretion when it comes to controlling the different elements within our structural costs. For example, depreciation and amortization expense largely is associated with prior capital spending decisions. On the other hand, while labor costs do not vary directly with production volume, manufacturing labor costs may be impacted by changes in volume, for example when we increase overtime, add a production shift, or add personnel to support volume increases. Other structural costs, such as advertising or engineering costs, do not necessarily have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume. Our structural costs generally are within our discretion, although to varying degrees, and can be adjusted over time in response to external factors. \\n \\n We consider certain structural costs to be a direct investment in future growth and revenue. For example, structural costs are necessary to grow our business and improve profitability, invest in new products and technologies, respond to increasing industry sales volume, and grow our market share. \\n \\n Cost of sales and Selling, administrative, and other expenses for full year 2023 were 161.3 billion. Company excluding Ford Credit s total material and commodity costs make up the largest portion of these costs and expenses, followed by structural costs. Although material costs are our largest absolute cost, our margins can be affected significantly by changes in any category of costs. \\n 42 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 2023 \\n \\n The net income attributable to Ford Motor Company was 4,347 million in 2023. Company adjusted EBIT was 10,416 million. \\n \\n Net income/(loss) includes certain items special items that are excluded from Company adjusted EBIT. These items are discussed in more detail in Note 26 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. We report special items separately to allow investors analyzing our results to identify certain infrequent significant items that they may wish to exclude when considering the trend of ongoing operating results. Our pre-tax and tax special items were as follows (in millions): \\n 2022 2023 Restructuring (by Geography) China (380) (958) Europe (151) (978) Ford Credit - Brazil (155) Other (a) (436) (87) Subtotal Restructuring (1,122) (2,023) Other Items Gain/(loss) on Rivian investment (7,377) (31) AV strategy including Argo impairment (2,812) Transit Connect customs matter (396) Russia suspension of operations/asset write-off (158) Patent matters related to prior calendar years (124) 8 EV program dispute (143) Other (including gains/(losses) on investments) (170) (165) Subtotal Other Items (10,641) (727) Pension and OPEB Gain/(Loss) Pension and OPEB remeasurement 29 (2,058) Pension settlements and curtailments (438) (339) Subtotal Pension and OPEB Gain/(Loss) (409) (2,397) Total EBIT Special Items (12,172) (5,147) Provision for/(Benefit from) tax special items (b) (2,573) (1,273) \\n __________ \\n (a) 2022 includes 298 million related to restructuring charges in India and 198 million in North America. 2023 includes 28 million related to restructuring charges in India and 41 million in North America. \\n (b) Includes related tax effect on special items and tax special items. \\n \\n We recorded 5.1 billion of pre-tax special item charges in 2023, driven primarily by pension and OPEB remeasurement, restructuring actions in Europe and China, and the Transit Connect customs matter. \\n \\n In Note 26 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, special items are reflected as a separate reconciling item, as opposed to being allocated among our segments. This reflects the fact that management excludes these items from its review of operating segment results for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources. \\n 43 \\n\\nItem 7.

The flat year-over-year Company adjusted EBIT primarily reflects higher Ford Pro and Ford Blue EBIT and a lower EBIT loss in Ford Next. Offsets included higher EBIT losses in Ford Model e, lower past service pension and OPEB income in Corporate Other, and lower Ford Credit EBT. \\n \\n 44 \\n\\nItem 7.

Structural costs include the following cost categories: \\n Manufacturing, Including Volume-Related - consists primarily of costs for hourly and salaried manufacturing personnel, plant overhead (such as utilities and taxes), and new product launch expense. These costs could be affected by volume for operating pattern actions such as overtime, line-speed, and shift schedules \\n Engineering and Connectivity consists primarily of costs for vehicle and software engineering personnel, prototype materials, testing, and outside engineering and software services \\n Spending-Related consists primarily of depreciation and amortization of our manufacturing and engineering assets, but also includes asset retirements and operating leases \\n Advertising and Sales Promotions includes costs for advertising, marketing programs, brand promotions, customer mailings and promotional events, and auto shows \\n Administrative, Information Technology, and Selling includes primarily costs for salaried personnel and purchased services related to our staff activities, information technology, and selling functions \\n Pension and OPEB consists primarily of past service pension costs and other postretirement employee benefit costs \\n \\n Exchange primarily measures EBIT variance driven by one or more of the following: (i) transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the relevant entities, (ii) effects of converting functional currency income to U.S. dollars, (iii) effects of remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities of the relevant entities in currencies other than their functional currency, or (iv) results of our foreign currency hedging \\n \\n Other includes a variety of items, such as parts and services earnings, royalties, government incentives, and compensation-related changes \\n \\n In addition, definitions and calculations used in this report include: \\n \\n Wholesales and Revenue wholesale unit volumes include all Ford and Lincoln badged units (whether produced by Ford or by an unconsolidated affiliate) that are sold to dealerships or others, units manufactured by Ford that are sold to other manufacturers, units distributed by Ford for other manufacturers, and local brand units produced by our China joint venture, Jiangling Motors Corporation, Ltd.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Ford Next Segment \\n \\n The Ford Next segment (formerly Mobility) primarily includes expenses and investments for emerging business initiatives aimed at creating value for Ford in vehicle-adjacent market segments. \\n \\n In this segment, our 2023 EBIT loss was 138 million, a 788 million improvement from a year ago. Ford Next has evolved from primarily investing in the development of autonomous vehicle capabilities to focus exclusively on incubating and launching new businesses creating strategic value for Ford. \\n 48 \\n\\nItem 7.

Ford Credit s loss metrics continue to normalize from historic lows. Ford Credit s U.S. 36-month auction values for off-lease vehicles were down 7 from a year ago. We are planning for full year 2024 auction values to decrease as vehicle availability continues to improve. \\n \\n Ford Credit s 2023 EBT of 1,331 million was 1,326 million lower than a year ago, reflecting lower financing margin, non-recurrence of supplemental depreciation and credit loss reserve releases, lower lease residual performance, unfavorable derivative market valuation, and higher credit losses. \\n 49 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Definitions and Information Regarding Ford Credit Causal Factors \\n \\n In general, we measure year-over-year changes in Ford Credit s EBT using the causal factors listed below: \\n \\n Volume and Mix: \\n Volume primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by changes in average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses at prior period financing margin yield (defined below in financing margin) at prior period exchange rates. Volume changes are primarily driven by the volume of new and used vehicles sold and leased, the extent to which Ford Credit purchases retail financing and operating lease contracts, the extent to which Ford Credit provides wholesale financing, the sales price of the vehicles financed, the level of dealer inventories, Ford-sponsored special financing programs available exclusively through Ford Credit, and the availability of cost-effective funding \\n Mix primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by period-over-period changes in the composition of Ford Credit s average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses by product within each region \\n \\n Financing Margin: \\n Financing margin variance is the period-over-period change in financing margin yield multiplied by the present period average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses at prior period exchange rates. This calculation is performed at the product and country level and then aggregated. Financing margin yield equals revenue, less interest expense and scheduled depreciation for the period, divided by average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses for the same period \\n Financing margin changes are driven by changes in revenue and interest expense. Changes in revenue are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, cost assumptions in pricing, mix of business, and competitive environment. Changes in interest expense are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, borrowing spreads, and asset-liability management \\n \\n Credit Loss: \\n Credit loss is the change in the provision for credit losses at prior period exchange rates. For analysis purposes, management splits the provision for credit losses into net charge-offs and the change in the allowance for credit losses \\n Net charge-off changes are primarily driven by the number of repossessions, severity per repossession, and recoveries. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are primarily driven by changes in historical trends in credit losses and recoveries, changes in the composition and size of Ford Credit s present portfolio, changes in trends in historical used vehicle values, and changes in forward looking macroeconomic conditions. For additional information, refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates - Allowance for Credit Losses section of Item 7 \\n \\n Lease Residual: \\n Lease residual measures changes to residual performance at prior period exchange rates. For analysis purposes, management splits residual performance primarily into residual gains and losses, and the change in accumulated supplemental depreciation \\n Residual gain and loss changes are primarily driven by the number of vehicles returned to Ford Credit and sold, and the difference between the auction value and the depreciated value (which includes both base and accumulated supplemental depreciation) of the vehicles sold. Changes in accumulated supplemental depreciation are primarily driven by changes in Ford Credit s estimate of the expected auction value at the end of the lease term, and changes in Ford Credit s estimate of the number of vehicles that will be returned to it and sold. Depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases includes early termination losses on operating leases due to customer default events. For additional information, refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates - Accumulated Depreciation on Vehicles Subject to Operating Leases section of Item 7 \\n \\n Exchange: \\n Reflects changes in EBT driven by the effects of converting functional currency income to U.S. dollars \\n \\n Other: \\n Primarily includes operating expenses, other revenue, insurance expenses, and other income/(loss) at prior period exchange rates \\n Changes in operating expenses are primarily driven by salaried personnel costs, facilities costs, and costs associated with the origination and servicing of customer contracts \\n In general, other income/(loss) changes are primarily driven by changes in earnings related to market valuation adjustments to derivatives (primarily related to movements in interest rates) and other miscellaneous items \\n 50 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n In addition, the following definitions and calculations apply to Ford Credit when used in this Report: \\n \\n Cash (as shown in the Funding Structure and Liquidity tables) Cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash, excluding amounts related to insurance activities \\n \\n Debt (as shown in the Key Metrics and Leverage tables) Debt on Ford Credit s balance sheets. Includes debt issued in securitizations and payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets and related enhancements. Ford Credit holds the right to receive the excess cash flows not needed to pay the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions \\n \\n Earnings Before Taxes EBT Reflects Ford Credit s income before income taxes \\n \\n Loss-to-Receivables LTR Ratio LTR ratio is calculated using net charge-offs divided by average finance receivables, excluding unearned interest supplements and the allowance for credit losses \\n \\n Return on Equity ROE (as shown in the Key Metrics table) Reflects return on equity calculated by annualizing net income for the period and dividing by monthly average equity for the period \\n \\n Securitization and Restricted Cash (as shown in the Liquidity table) Securitization cash is held for the benefit of the securitization investors (for example, a reserve fund). Restricted cash primarily includes cash held to meet certain local governmental and regulatory reserve requirements and cash held under the terms of certain contractual agreements \\n \\n Securitizations (as shown in the Public Term Funding Plan table) Public securitization transactions, Rule 144A offerings sponsored by Ford Credit, and widely distributed offerings by Ford Credit Canada \\n \\n Term Asset-Backed Securities (as shown in the Funding Structure table) Obligations issued in securitization transactions that are payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets and related enhancements \\n \\n Total Net Receivables (as shown in the Key Metrics table) Includes finance receivables (retail financing and wholesale) sold for legal purposes and net investment in operating leases included in securitization transactions that do not satisfy the requirements for accounting sale treatment. These receivables and operating leases are reported on Ford Credit s balance sheets and are available only for payment of the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions; they are not available to pay the other obligations of Ford Credit or the claims of Ford Credit s other creditors \\n \\n 51 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Corporate Other \\n \\n Corporate Other primarily includes corporate governance expenses, past service pension and OPEB income and expense, interest income (excluding Ford Credit interest income and interest earned on our extended service contract portfolio) and gains and losses from our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding gains and losses on investments in equity securities), and foreign exchange derivatives gains and losses associated with intercompany lending. Corporate governance expenses are primarily administrative, delivering benefit on behalf of the global enterprise, that are not allocated to operating segments. These include expenses related to setting and directing global policy, providing oversight and stewardship, and promoting the Company s interests. For full year 2023, Corporate Other had a 760 million EBIT loss, compared with 748 million of positive EBIT in 2022. The EBIT deterioration was driven by lower past service pension and OPEB income, partially offset by higher Company excluding Ford Credit interest income, reflecting higher interest rates. \\n\\nInterest on Debt \\n \\n Interest on Debt consists of interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit. Our full year 2023 interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit was 1,302 million, 43 million higher than in 2022. \\n\\nTaxes \\n \\n Our Provision for/(Benefit from) income taxes for full year 2023 was a 362 million benefit, resulting in an effective tax rate of negative 9.1 . This includes benefits arising from U.S. research tax credits and legal entity restructuring within our leasing operations and China. \\n \\n Our full year 2023 adjusted effective tax rate, which excludes special items, was 10.0 . \\n \\n We regularly review our organizational structure and income tax elections for affiliates in non-U.S. and U.S. tax jurisdictions, which may result in changes in affiliates that are included in or excluded from our U.S. tax return. Any future changes to our structure, as well as any changes in income tax laws in the countries that we operate, could cause increases or decreases to our deferred tax balances and related valuation allowances. \\n 52 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 2022 \\n \\n The net loss attributable to Ford Motor Company was 1,981 million in 2022. Company adjusted EBIT was 10,415 million. \\n \\n Net income/(loss) includes certain items special items that are excluded from Company adjusted EBIT. These items are discussed in more detail in Note 26 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. We report special items separately to allow investors analyzing our results to identify certain infrequent significant items that they may wish to exclude when considering the trend of ongoing operating results. Our pre-tax and tax special items were as follows (in millions): \\n 2021 2022 Global Redesign Europe (530) (151) India (468) (298) South America (803) 53 China (including Taiwan) 150 (380) North America (72) (198) Other 3 7 Subtotal Global Redesign (1,720) (967) Other Items Gain/(loss) on Rivian investment \\n 9,096 (7,377) Debt extinguishment premium (1,692) (135) AV strategy including Argo impairment (2,812) Ford Credit Brazil restructuring 14 (155) Russia suspension of operations/asset write-off (158) Patent matters related to prior calendar years (124) Other 82 (35) Subtotal Other Items 7,500 (10,796) Pension and OPEB Gain/(Loss) Pension and OPEB remeasurement 3,873 29 Pension settlements and curtailments (70) (438) Subtotal Pension and OPEB Gain/(Loss) 3,803 (409) Total EBIT Special Items 9,583 (12,172) Cash effect of Global Redesign (incl. separations) (1,935) (377) Provision for/(Benefit from) tax special items (a) (1,924) (2,573) \\n __________ \\n (a) Includes related tax effect on special items and tax special items. \\n \\n For full year 2022, we recorded 12.2 billion of pre-tax special item charges, driven by a 7.4 billion mark-to-market net loss on our Rivian investment and a 2.7 billion impairment on our Argo investment. \\n \\n In Note 26 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, special items are reflected as a separate reconciling item, as opposed to being allocated among our segments. This reflects the fact that management excludes these items from its review of operating segment results for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources. \\n 53 \\n\\nItem 7.

Ford Credit s loss metrics reflected healthy and stable consumer credit conditions and strong auction values. Ford Credit s U.S. 36-month auction values for off-lease vehicles were up 5 from 2021, reflecting strong demand for used vehicles, including the impact of lower new vehicle production due to the semiconductor shortage. \\n \\n Ford Credit s 2022 EBT of 2,657 million was 2,060 million lower than 2021, reflecting lower credit loss and lease residual reserve releases, lower financing margin, and lower lease return rates. \\n \\n 57 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Corporate Other \\n \\n For full year 2022, Corporate Other EBIT was 748 million, compared with EBIT of 1,247 million in 2021. The deterioration was driven by lower past service pension and OPEB income. \\n\\nInterest on Debt \\n \\n Our full year 2022 interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit was 1,259 million, 544 million lower than in 2021, primarily explained by U.S. debt restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2021 and during 2022. \\n\\nTaxes \\n \\n Our Provision for/(Benefit from) income taxes for full year 2022 was a 864 million benefit, resulting in an effective tax rate of 28.6 . This includes benefits arising from the reversal of U.S. valuation allowances, primarily as a result of planning actions. \\n \\n Our full year 2022 adjusted effective tax rate, which excludes special items, was 18.7 . \\n 58 \\n\\nItem 7.

Our key priority is to maintain a strong balance sheet to withstand potential stress scenarios, while having resources available to invest in and grow our business. At December 31, 2023, we had Company cash of 28.8 billion and liquidity of 46.4 billion. At December 31, 2023, about 90 of Company cash was held by consolidated entities domiciled in the United States. \\n \\n To be prepared for an economic downturn and other stress scenarios, we target an ongoing Company cash balance at or above 20 billion plus significant additional liquidity above our Company cash target. We expect to have periods when we will be above or below this amount due to: (i) future cash flow expectations, such as for investments in future opportunities, capital investments, debt maturities, pension contributions, or restructuring requirements, (ii) short-term timing differences, and (iii) changes in the global economic or operating environment. \\n \\n Our Company cash investments primarily include U.S. Department of Treasury obligations, federal agency securities, bank time deposits with investment-grade institutions, investment-grade corporate securities, investment-grade commercial paper, and debt obligations of a select group of non-U.S. governments, non-U.S. governmental agencies, and supranational institutions. The average maturity of these investments is approximately one year and adjusted based on market conditions and liquidity needs. We monitor our Company cash levels and average maturity on a daily basis. \\n\\n59 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Material Cash Requirements. Our material cash requirements include: \\n \\n Capital expenditures (for additional information, see the Changes in Company Cash section below) and other payments for engineering, software, product development, and implementation of our plans for electric vehicles \\n \\n Purchase of raw materials and components to support the manufacturing and sale of vehicles (including electric vehicles), parts, and accessories (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table and the accompanying description of our Purchase obligations below) \\n \\n Marketing incentive payments to dealers \\n \\n Payments for warranty and field service actions (for additional information, see Note 25 of the Notes to the Financial Statements) \\n \\n Debt repayments (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table below and Note 19 of the Notes the Financial Statements) \\n \\n Discretionary and mandatory payments to our global pension plans (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table below, the Changes in Company Cash section below, and Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements) \\n \\n Employee wages, benefits, and incentives \\n \\n Operating lease payments (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table below and Note 18 of the Notes to the Financial Statements) \\n \\n Cash effects related to the restructuring of our business \\n \\n Strategic acquisitions and investments to grow our business, including electrification \\n \\n Subject to approval by our Board of Directors, shareholder distributions in the form of dividend payments and/or a share repurchase program (including share repurchases to offset the anti-dilutive effect of increased shared-based compensation) may require the expenditure of a material amount of cash. We target shareholder distributions of 40 to 50 of adjusted free cash flow. Moreover, we may be subject to additional material cash requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, e.g., legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions, and other matters. \\n \\n We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties, and, as noted above, such commitments require a material amount of cash. Most of these are debt obligations incurred by our Ford Credit segment. In addition, as part of our normal business practices, we enter into contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components, and services to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services. These arrangements, including multi-year offtake commitments, may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase requirements. Purchase obligations in the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table below are defined as off-balance sheet agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms; however, as we purchase raw materials and components beyond the minimum amounts required by the Purchase obligations, our material cash requirements for these items are higher than what is reflected in the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table. For additional information on the timing of these payments and the impact on our working capital, see the Changes in Company Cash section below. \\n 60 \\n\\nItem 7.

See Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for further information regarding our expected pension contributions. \\n (f) Purchase obligations under existing offtake agreements for scarce raw materials are not included in the table above. As of December 31, 2023, our estimated expenditures for the maximum quantity that we are committed to purchase under these offtake agreements through 2035, subject to certain conditions, consist of approximately 4.5 billion of purchase obligations and approximately 8 billion of contingent purchase obligations based on our present forecast. However, our forecast could fluctuate from period to period based on market prices, which could result in significant increases or decreases in our estimate. The actual price paid for these materials will be recorded on our balance sheet at the time of purchase. In addition, as market conditions dictate, we may enter into additional offtake agreements with raw material suppliers or seek to renegotiate existing agreements. For additional information, see the discussion of our offtake agreements below on page 62. \\n \\n We plan to utilize our liquidity (as described above) and our cash flows from business operations to fund our material cash requirements. \\n \\n Changes in Company Cash. In managing our business, we classify changes in Company cash into operating and non-operating items. Operating items include: Company adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit EBT, capital spending, depreciation and tooling amortization, changes in working capital, Ford Credit distributions, interest on debt, cash taxes, and all other and timing differences (including timing differences between accrual-based EBIT and associated cash flows). Non-operating items include: restructuring costs, changes in Company debt excluding Ford Credit, contributions to funded pension plans, shareholder distributions, and other items (including gains and losses on investments in equity securities, acquisitions and divestitures, equity investments, and other transactions with Ford Credit). \\n\\n61 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n With respect to Changes in working capital, in general, the Company excluding Ford Credit carries relatively low trade receivables compared with our trade payables because the majority of our wholesales are financed (primarily by Ford Credit) immediately upon the sale of vehicles to dealers, which generally occurs shortly after being produced. In contrast, our trade payables are based primarily on industry-standard production supplier payment terms of about 45 days. As a result, our cash flow deteriorates if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) decrease while trade payables continue to become due. Conversely, our cash flow improves if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) increase while new trade payables are generally not due for about 45 days. For example, the suspension of production at most of our assembly plants and lower industry volumes due to COVID-19 in early 2020 resulted in an initial deterioration of our cash flow, while the subsequent resumption of manufacturing operations and return to pre-COVID-19 production levels at most of our assembly plants resulted in a subsequent improvement of our cash flow. Even in normal economic conditions, however, these working capital balances generally are subject to seasonal changes that can impact cash flow. For example, we typically experience cash flow timing differences associated with inventories and payables due to our annual shutdown periods when production, and therefore inventories and wholesale volumes, are usually at their lowest levels, while payables continue to come due and be paid. The net impact of this typically results in cash outflows from changes in our working capital balances during these shutdown periods. \\n \\n Our finished product inventory at December 31, 2023 was higher than at December 31, 2022, primarily reflecting higher in-transit inventory. \\n \\n In response to, or in anticipation of, supplier disruptions, we may stockpile certain components or raw materials to help prevent disruption in our production of vehicles. Such actions could have a short-term adverse impact on our cash and increase our inventory. Moreover, in order to secure critical materials for production of electric vehicles, we have entered into and we may, in the future, enter into offtake agreements with raw material suppliers and make investments in certain raw material and battery suppliers, including contributing up to a maximum of 6.6 billion in capital to BlueOval SK, LLC over a five-year period ending in 2026. Our actual capital outlay could vary significantly based on the final project costs and potential financing opportunities. Such investments could have an additional adverse impact on our cash in the near-term. \\n \\n The terms of the offtake agreements we have entered into, and those we may enter into in the future, vary by transaction, though they generally obligate us to purchase a certain percentage or minimum amount of output produced by the counterparty over an agreed upon period of time. The purchase price mechanism included in the offtake agreement is typically based on the market price of the material at the time of delivery. The terms also may include conditions to our obligation to purchase the materials, such as quality or minimum output. Subject to satisfaction of those conditions, we will be obligated to purchase the materials at the cost determined by the purchase price mechanism. Based on the offtake agreements we have entered into thus far, the earliest date by which we could be obligated to purchase any output, subject to satisfaction of the applicable conditions, will be in 2024. \\n \\n Unlike our historical arrangements with suppliers, under multi-year offtake agreements, the risks associated with lower-than-expected electric vehicle production volumes or changes in battery technology that reduce the need for certain raw materials are borne by Ford rather than our suppliers. Accordingly, in the event we do not purchase the materials pursuant to the terms of these agreements and we are unable to restructure an agreement or an alternate purchaser is unable to be found, Ford retains its obligation for the cost of those materials. For additional discussion of the risks related to our offtake agreements and other long-term purchase contracts, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. \\n \\n Financial institutions participate in a supply chain finance SCF program that enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their Ford receivables (i.e., our payment obligations to the suppliers) to the financial institutions on a non-recourse basis in order to be paid earlier than our payment terms provide. Our suppliers voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms, the amounts we pay, or our liquidity. We have no economic interest in a supplier s decision to participate in the SCF program, and we do not provide any guarantees in connection with it. As of December 31, 2023, the outstanding amount of Ford receivables that suppliers elected to sell to the SCF financial institutions was 220 million. The amount settled through the SCF program during 2023 was 1.8 billion. \\n \\n 62 \\n\\nItem 7.

The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher net income. \\n \\n Company adjusted free cash flow was 6.8 billion, 2.3 billion lower than a year ago. An improvement in Company adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit and timing differences were more than offset by the non-repeat of working capital improvements and Ford Credit distributions, as well as higher capital spending. \\n \\n Capital spending was 8.2 billion in 2023, 1.6 billion higher than a year ago, and is expected to be in the range of 8 billion to 9.5 billion in 2024. \\n \\n The full year 2023 working capital impact was 2.4 billion negative, driven by an increase in inventory and receivables. All other and timing differences were positive 5.2 billion. Timing differences include differences between accrual-based EBIT and the associated cash flows (e.g., marketing incentive and warranty payments to dealers, JV equity income, compensation payments, and pension and OPEB income or expense). \\n \\n Shareholder distributions (including cash dividends and anti-dilutive share repurchases) were 5.3 billion in 2023. On February 6, 2024, we declared a regular dividend of 0.15 per share and a supplemental dividend of 0.18 per share. \\n 63 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Available Credit Lines . Total Company committed credit lines, excluding Ford Credit, at December 31, 2023 were 19.4 billion, consisting of 13.5 billion of our corporate credit facility, 2.0 billion of our supplemental revolving credit facility, 1.8 billion of our 364-day revolving credit facility, and 2.2 billion of local credit facilities. At December 31, 2023, the utilized portion of the corporate credit facility was 18 million, representing amounts utilized for letters of credit. In addition, 1.8 billion of committed Company credit lines, excluding Ford Credit, was utilized under local credit facilities for our affiliates as of December 31, 2023. \\n \\n Lenders under our corporate credit facility have 3.4 billion of commitments maturing on April 26, 2026 and 10.1 billion of commitments maturing on April 26, 2028. Lenders under our supplemental revolving credit facility have 0.1 billion of commitments maturing on September 29, 2024 and 1.9 billion of commitments maturing on April 26, 2026. Lenders under our 364-day revolving credit facility have 1.8 billion of commitments maturing on April 24, 2024. \\n \\n On August 17, 2023, we entered into a new 364-day revolving credit facility, with 4 billion of commitments maturing on August 15, 2024. At the time we entered into this credit facility, it provided additional working capital flexibility to manage through uncertainties in the present environment, including a potential labor disruption. With the ratification of the new UAW contract, this credit facility was terminated as of November 24, 2023. \\n \\n The corporate, supplemental, and 364-day credit agreements include certain sustainability-linked targets, pursuant to which the applicable margin and facility fees may be adjusted if Ford achieves, or fails to achieve, the specified targets related to global manufacturing facility greenhouse gas emissions, renewable electricity consumption, and Ford Europe CO 2 tailpipe emissions. Ford outperformed the 2022 targets for all three of the sustainability-linked metrics, which favorably impacted pricing beginning in the third quarter of 2023 . \\n \\n The corporate credit facility is unsecured and free of material adverse change conditions to borrowing, restrictive financial covenants (for example, interest or fixed-charge coverage ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and minimum net worth requirements), and credit rating triggers that could limit our ability to obtain funding or trigger early repayment. The corporate credit facility contains a liquidity covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum of 4 billion in aggregate of domestic cash, cash equivalents, and loaned and marketable securities and/or availability under the corporate credit facility, supplemental revolving credit facility, and 364-day revolving credit facility. The terms and conditions of the supplemental and 364-day revolving credit facilities are consistent with our corporate credit facility. Ford Credit has been designated as a subsidiary borrower under the corporate credit facility and the 364-day revolving credit facility. \\n \\n Each of the corporate credit facility, supplemental revolving credit facility, and 364-day revolving credit facility include a covenant that requires us to provide guarantees from certain of our subsidiaries in the event that our senior, unsecured, long-term debt does not maintain at least two investment grade ratings from Fitch, Moody s, and S P. On October 30, 2023, following the upgrade by S P of our senior, unsecured, long-term debt credit rating to BBB-, the unsecured guarantees provided by the following subsidiaries to the lenders under the credit facilities were released: Ford Component Sales, LLC; Ford European Holdings Inc.; Ford Global Technologies, LLC; Ford Holdings LLC (the parent company of Ford Credit); Ford International Capital LLC; Ford Mexico Holdings LLC; Ford Motor Service Company; Ford Next LLC; Ford Trading Company, LLC; and Ford Van Dyke Investment Fund, Inc. \\n \\n Debt. As shown in Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, at December 31, 2023, Company debt excluding Ford Credit was 19.9 billion, unchanged from December 31, 2022. \\n \\n Leverage. We manage Company debt (excluding Ford Credit) levels with a leverage framework that targets investment grade credit ratings through a normal business cycle. The leverage framework includes a ratio of total Company debt (excluding Ford Credit), underfunded pension liabilities, operating leases, and other adjustments, divided by Company adjusted EBIT (excluding Ford Credit EBT), and further adjusted to exclude depreciation and tooling amortization (excluding Ford Credit). \\n \\n Ford Credit s leverage is calculated as a separate business as described in the Liquidity - Ford Credit Segment section of Item 7. Ford Credit is self-funding and its debt, which is used to fund its operations, is separate from our Company debt excluding Ford Credit. \\n \\n 64 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Ford Credit Segment \\n \\n Ford Credit remains well capitalized with a strong balance sheet and funding diversified across platforms and markets. Ford Credit continues to have robust access to the capital markets, and ended 2023 with 25.7 billion of liquidity, up 4.6 billion from 2022. \\n \\n Key elements of Ford Credit s funding strategy include: \\n \\n Maintain strong liquidity and funding diversity \\n Prudently access public markets \\n Continue to leverage retail deposit funding in Europe \\n Flexibility to increase ABS mix as needed; preserving assets and committed capacity \\n Target financial statement leverage of 9:1 to 10:1 \\n Maintain self-liquidating balance sheet \\n \\n Ford Credit s liquidity profile continues to be diverse, robust, and focused on maintaining liquidity levels that meet its business and funding requirements. Ford Credit regularly stress tests its balance sheet and liquidity to ensure that it can continue to meet its financial obligations through economic cycles. \\n \\n Funding Sources. Ford Credit s funding sources include primarily unsecured debt and securitization transactions (including other structured financings). Ford Credit issues both short-term and long-term debt that is held by both institutional and retail investors, with long-term debt having an original maturity of more than 12 months. Ford Credit sponsors a number of securitization programs that can be structured to provide both short-term and long-term funding through institutional investors and other financial institutions in the United States and international capital markets. \\n \\n Ford Credit obtains unsecured funding from the sale of demand notes under its Ford Interest Advantage program and through the retail deposit programs at FCE Bank plc FCE and Ford Bank GmbH Ford Bank ). At December 31, 2023, the principal amount outstanding of Ford Interest Advantage notes, which may be redeemed at any time at the option of the holders thereof without restriction, and FCE and Ford Bank deposits was 17.2 billion. Ford Credit maintains multiple sources of readily available liquidity to fund the payment of its unsecured short-term debt obligations. \\n \\n The following table shows funding for Ford Credit s net receivables (in billions): December 31, 2021 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2023 Funding Structure Term unsecured debt 59.4 48.3 54.1 Term asset-backed securities 45.4 56.4 58.0 Retail Deposits / Ford Interest Advantage 12.9 14.3 17.2 Other (0.1) 2.7 1.4 Equity 12.4 11.9 13.4 Adjustments for cash (12.5) (11.3) (10.9) Total Net Receivables 117.5 122.3 133.2 Securitized Funding as Percent of Total Debt 38.5 47.4 44.9 \\n \\n Net receivables of 133.2 billion at December 31, 2023 were funded primarily with term unsecured debt and term asset-backed securities. Securitized funding as a percent of total debt was 44.9 as of December 31, 2023. \\n\\n65 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Public Term Funding Plan. The following table shows Ford Credit s issuances for full year 2021, 2022, and 2023, and its planned issuances for full year 2024, excluding short-term funding programs (in billions): \\n 2021 \\n Actual \\n 2022 \\n Actual \\n 2023 \\n Actual \\n 2024 \\n Forecast \\n Unsecured 5 6 14 14 - 17 Securitizations 9 10 14 13 - 16 Total public 14 16 28 27 - 33 \\n \\n In 2023, Ford Credit completed 28 billion of public term funding. For 2024, Ford Credit projects full year public term funding in the range of 27 billion to 33 billion. Through February 5, 2024, we completed 5 billion of public term issuances. \\n \\n Liquidity.

At December 31, 2023, Ford Credit s net liquidity available for use was 25.7 billion, 4.6 billion higher than year-end 2022, reflecting strong access to public funding markets and the addition of 5.5 billion in committed asset-backed capacity. Ford Credit s sources of liquidity include cash, committed asset-backed facilities, and unsecured credit facilities. At December 31, 2023, Ford Credit s liquidity sources, including cash, committed asset-backed facilities, and unsecured credit facilities, totaled 56.2 billion, up 5.2 billion from year-end 2022. \\n \\n Material Cash Requirements. Ford Credit s material cash requirements include: (1) the purchase of retail financing and operating lease contracts from dealers and providing wholesale financing for dealers to finance new and used vehicles; and (2) debt repayments (for additional information on debt, see the Balance Sheet Liquidity Profile section below, the Material Cash Requirements section in Liquidity and Capital Resources - Company excluding Ford Credit above, and Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements). In addition, subject to approval by Ford Credit s Board of Directors, shareholder distributions may require the expenditure of a material amount of cash. Moreover, Ford Credit may be subject to additional material cash requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, e.g., legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions, and other matters. \\n \\n Ford Credit plans to utilize its liquidity (as described above) and its cash flows from business operations to fund its material cash requirements. \\n \\n 66 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Balance Sheet Liquidity Profile. Ford Credit defines its balance sheet liquidity profile as the cumulative maturities, including the impact of expected prepayments and allowance for credit losses, of its finance receivables, investment in operating leases, and cash, less the cumulative debt maturities over upcoming annual periods. Ford Credit s balance sheet is inherently liquid because of the short-term nature of its finance receivables, investment in operating leases, and cash. Ford Credit ensures its cumulative debt maturities have a longer tenor than its cumulative asset maturities. This positive maturity profile is intended to provide Ford Credit with additional liquidity after all of its assets have been funded and is in addition to liquidity available to protect for stress scenarios. \\n \\n The following table shows Ford Credit s cumulative maturities for assets and total debt for the periods presented and unsecured long-term debt maturities in the individual periods presented (in billions): \\n 2024 2025 2026 2027 and Beyond \\n Balance Sheet Liquidity Profile Assets (a) 76 104 126 149 Total debt (b) 61 88 105 131 Memo: Unsecured long-term debt maturities 12 13 11 21 \\n __________ \\n (a) Includes gross finance receivables less the allowance for credit losses (including certain finance receivables that are reclassified in consolidation to Trade and other receivables ), investment in operating leases net of accumulated depreciation, cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding amounts related to insurance activities). Amounts shown include the impact of expected prepayments. \\n (b) Excludes unamortized debt (discount)/premium, unamortized issuance costs, and fair value adjustments. \\n \\n Maturities of investment in operating leases consist primarily of the portion of rental payments attributable to depreciation over the remaining life of the lease and the expected residual value at lease termination. Maturities of finance receivables and investment in operating leases in the table above include expected prepayments for Ford Credit s retail installment sale contracts and investment in operating leases. The table above also reflects adjustments to debt maturities to match the asset-backed debt maturities with the underlying asset maturities. \\n \\n All wholesale securitization transactions and wholesale receivables are shown maturing in the next 12 months, even if the maturities extend beyond 2024. The retail securitization transactions under certain committed asset-backed facilities are assumed to amortize immediately rather than amortizing after the expiration of the commitment period. As of December 31, 2023, Ford Credit had 149 billion of assets, 68 billion of which were unencumbered. \\n \\n Funding and Liquidity Risks. Ford Credit s funding plan is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control, including disruption in the capital markets that could impact both unsecured debt and asset-backed securities issuance and the effects of regulatory changes on the financial markets. \\n \\n Despite Ford Credit s diverse sources of funding and liquidity, its ability to maintain liquidity may be affected by, among others, the following factors (not necessarily listed in order of importance or probability of occurrence): \\n \\n Prolonged disruption of the debt and securitization markets; \\n Global capital markets volatility; \\n Credit ratings assigned to Ford and Ford Credit; \\n Market capacity for Ford- and Ford Credit-sponsored investments; \\n General demand for the type of securities Ford Credit offers; \\n Ford Credit s ability to continue funding through asset-backed financing structures; \\n Performance of the underlying assets within Ford Credit s asset-backed financing structures; \\n Inability to obtain hedging instruments; \\n Accounting and regulatory changes; and \\n Ford Credit s ability to maintain credit facilities and committed asset-backed facilities. \\n \\n Stress Tests. Ford Credit regularly conducts stress testing on its funding and liquidity sources to ensure it can continue to meet financial obligations and support the sale of Ford and Lincoln vehicles during firm-specific and market-wide stress events. Stress tests are intended to quantify the potential impact of various adverse scenarios on the balance sheet and liquidity. These scenarios include assumptions on access to unsecured and secured debt markets, runoff of short-term funding, and ability to renew expiring liquidity commitments and are measured over various time periods, including 30 days, 90 days, and longer term. Ford Credit s stress test does not assume any additional funding, liquidity, or capital support from Ford. Ford Credit routinely develops contingency funding plans as part of its liquidity stress testing. \\n 67 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Leverage. Ford Credit uses leverage, or the debt-to-equity ratio, to make various business decisions, including evaluating and establishing pricing for finance receivable and operating lease financing, and assessing its capital structure. \\n \\n The table below shows the calculation of Ford Credit s financial statement leverage (in billions): December 31, 2021 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2023 Leverage Calculation Debt 117.7 119.0 129.3 Equity (a) 12.4 11.9 13.4 Financial statement leverage (to 1) 9.5 10.0 9.7 \\n __________ \\n (a) Total shareholder s interest reported on Ford Credit s balance sheets. \\n \\n Ford Credit plans its leverage by considering market conditions and the risk characteristics of its business. At December 31, 2023, Ford Credit s financial statement leverage was 9.7:1. Ford Credit targets financial statement leverage in the range of 9:1 to 10:1. \\n 68 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Total Company \\n \\n Pension Plan Contributions and Strategy. Our strategy is to reduce the risk of our funded defined benefit pension plans, including minimizing the volatility of the value of our pension assets relative to pension liabilities and the need for unplanned use of capital resources to fund the plans. The strategy reduces balance sheet, cash flow, and income exposures and, in turn, reduces our risk profile. Going forward, we expect to: \\n \\n Limit our pension contributions to offset ongoing service cost, ensure our funded plans remain fully funded in aggregate, and meet regulatory requirements, if any; \\n Minimize the volatility of the value of our pension assets relative to pension obligations and ensure assets are sufficient to pay plan benefits; and \\n Evaluate strategic actions to reduce pension liabilities, such as plan design changes, curtailments, or settlements \\n 2022 2023 2023 \\n H / (L) \\n 2022 \\n Pension Funded Status B) \\n U.S. Plans 0.1 (1.3) (1.4) Non-U.S. Plans (0.3) (1.0) (0.7) Total Global Pension (0.2) (2.3) (2.1) Year-End Discount Rate (Weighted Average) \\n U.S. Plans 5.51 5.17 (34) bps Non-U.S. Plans 4.42 3.98 (44) bps Actual Asset Returns U.S. Plans (21.20) 7.41 28.61 ppts Non-U.S. Plans (25.40) 5.56 30.96 ppts Pension - Funded Plans Only B) \\n Funded Status 4.1 2.1 (2.0) Contributions for Funded Plans 0.6 0.6 \\n \\n Worldwide, our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by 2.3 billion at December 31, 2023, a deterioration of 2.1 billion from December 31, 2022, primarily reflecting the impact of lower discount rates compared to year-end 2022 and pension benefit enhancements as part of the collective bargaining agreements in the United States and Canada, partially offset by asset gains in excess of our assumptions. Of the 2.3 billion underfunded status at year-end 2023, our funded plans were 2.1 billion overfunded and our unfunded plans were 4.4 billion underfunded. These unfunded plans are pay as you go with benefits paid from Company cash and primarily include certain plans in Germany and U.S. defined benefit plans for senior management. \\n \\n The fixed income mix was 76 in our U.S. plans and 78 in our non-U.S. plans at year-end 2023. \\n \\n In 2023, we contributed 592 million to our global funded pension plans, an increase of 25 million compared with 2022. During 2024, we expect to contribute about 1 billion of cash to our global funded pension plans. We also expect to make about 400 million of benefit payments to participants in unfunded plans. Based on current assumptions and regulations, we do not expect to have a legal requirement to fund our major U.S. plans in 2024. Our global funded plans remain fully funded in aggregate, demonstrating the effectiveness of our de-risking strategy and our commitment to a strong balance sheet. \\n \\n For a detailed discussion of our pension plans, refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates - Pensions and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2023 Form 10-K Report and Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. \\n 69 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Return on Invested Capital ROIC ). We analyze total Company performance using an adjusted ROIC financial metric based on an after-tax rolling four quarter average. The following table contains the calculation of our ROIC for the years shown (in billions): December 31, 2021 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2023 Adjusted Net Operating Profit/(Loss) After Cash Tax Net income/(loss) attributable to Ford 17.9 (2.0) 4.3 Add: Noncontrolling interest (0.2) Less: Income tax 0.1 0.9 0.4 Add: Cash tax (0.6) (0.8) (1.0) Less: Interest on debt (1.8) (1.3) (1.3) Less: Total pension / OPEB income / (cost) 4.9 0.4 (3.1) Add: Pension / OPEB service costs (1.1) (1.0) (0.6) Net operating profit/(loss) after cash tax 13.0 (3.9) 6.7 Less: Special items (excl. pension / OPEB) pre-tax 5.9 (11.7) (2.7) Adjusted net operating profit/(loss) after cash tax 7.1 7.8 9.5 Invested Capital Equity 48.6 43.2 42.8 Debt (excl.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n CREDIT RATINGS \\n \\n Our short-term and long-term debt is rated by four credit rating agencies designated as nationally recognized statistical rating organizations NRSROs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission: DBRS, Fitch, Moody s, and S P. \\n \\n In several markets, locally recognized rating agencies also rate us. A credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the credit risk associated with a corporate entity or particular securities issued by that entity. Rating agencies ratings of us are based on information provided by us and other sources. Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria for evaluating company risk and, therefore, ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. \\n \\n The following rating actions were taken by these NRSROs since the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023: \\n \\n On October 30, 2023, S P upgraded the credit ratings for Ford and Ford Credit to BBB- from BB+ and revised the outlook to stable from positive. \\n \\n The following table summarizes certain of the credit ratings and outlook presently assigned by these four NRSROs: NRSRO RATINGS Ford Ford Credit NRSROs Issuer Default / Corporate / Issuer Rating Long-Term Senior Unsecured Outlook / Trend Long-Term Senior Unsecured Short-Term Unsecured Outlook / Trend Minimum Long-Term Investment Grade Rating DBRS BBB (low) BBB (low) Stable BBB (low) R-2 (low) Stable BBB (low) Fitch BBB- BBB- Stable BBB- F3 Stable BBB- Moody s N/A Ba1 Stable Ba1 NP Stable Baa3 S P BBB- BBB- Stable BBB- A-3 Stable BBB- \\n \\n 71 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n OUTLOOK \\n \\n We provided 2024 Company guidance in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K dated February 6, 2024. The guidance is based on our expectations as of February 6, 2024, and assumes no material change to our current assumptions for inflation, logistics issues, production, or macroeconomic conditions. Our actual results could differ materially from our guidance due to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including those set forth in Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I. 2024 Guidance Total Company Adjusted EBIT (a) 10 - 12 billion Adjusted Free Cash Flow (a) 6 - 7 billion Capital spending 8 - 9.5 billion Ford Credit EBT About 1.5 billion \\n __________ \\n (a) When we provide guidance for Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted Free Cash Flow, we do not provide guidance for the most comparable GAAP measures because, as described in more detail below in Non-GAAP Measures That Supplement GAAP Measures, they include items that are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty. \\n\\nFor full-year 2024, we expect adjusted EBIT of 10 billion to 12 billion and adjusted free cash flow of 6 billion to 7 billion. \\n \\n On a segment basis, we expect: \\n \\n Ford Pro EBIT of 8 billion to 9 billion driven by continued growth and favorable mix, partially offset by moderated pricing \\n Ford Blue EBIT of 7 billion to 7.5 billion, reflecting a balanced market equation, including the impact of our all-new F-150 launch; we also expect costs to be flat as we offset higher labor and product cost with efficiencies \\n Ford Model e EBIT loss of 5 billion to 5.5 billion, primarily driven by continued pricing pressure and investments in next generation vehicles \\n Ford Credit EBT of about 1.5 billion \\n \\n Our outlook for 2024 assumes: \\n \\n Flat to modest U.S. industry growth at 16 million to 16.5 million \\n Non-recurrence of the UAW strike \\n Full year of all-new Super Duty, which drives positive pricing and mix in Ford Pro \\n Lower industry pricing as supply and demand normalize \\n 2 billion benefit from cost reduction initiatives, offsetting higher labor and major product refresh actions \\n\\n72 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements \\n \\n Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations, forecasts, and assumptions by our management and involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: \\n \\n Ford is highly dependent on its suppliers to deliver components in accordance with Ford s production schedule and specifications, and a shortage of or inability to acquire key components or raw materials, such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, can disrupt Ford s production of vehicles; \\n To facilitate access to the raw materials and other components necessary for the production of electric vehicles, Ford has entered into and may, in the future, enter into multi-year commitments to raw material and other suppliers that subject Ford to risks associated with lower future demand for such items as well as costs that fluctuate and are difficult to accurately forecast; \\n Ford s long-term competitiveness depends on the successful execution of Ford+; \\n Ford s vehicles could be affected by defects that result in recall campaigns, increased warranty costs, or delays in new model launches, and the time it takes to improve the quality of our vehicles and services could continue to have an adverse effect on our business; \\n Ford may not realize the anticipated benefits of existing or pending strategic alliances, joint ventures, acquisitions, divestitures, or business strategies; \\n Ford may not realize the anticipated benefits of restructuring actions and such actions may cause Ford to incur significant charges, disrupt our operations, or harm our reputation; \\n Operational information systems, security systems, vehicles, and services could be affected by cybersecurity incidents, ransomware attacks, and other disruptions and impact Ford and Ford Credit as well as their suppliers and dealers; \\n Ford s production, as well as Ford s suppliers production, and/or the ability to deliver products to consumers could be disrupted by labor issues, public health issues, natural or man-made disasters, adverse effects of climate change, financial distress, production difficulties, capacity limitations, or other factors; \\n Failure to develop and deploy secure digital services that appeal to customers could have a negative impact on Ford s business; \\n Ford s ability to maintain a competitive cost structure could be affected by labor or other constraints; \\n Ford s ability to attract, develop, grow, and reward talent is critical to its success and competitiveness; \\n Ford s new and existing products and digital, software, and physical services are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries, and its reputation may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced; \\n Ford s results are dependent on sales of larger, more profitable vehicles, particularly in the United States; \\n With a global footprint and supply chain, Ford s results and operations could be adversely affected by economic or geopolitical developments, including protectionist trade policies such as tariffs, or other events; \\n Industry sales volume can be volatile and could decline if there is a financial crisis, recession, public health emergency, or significant geopolitical event; \\n Ford may face increased price competition or a reduction in demand for its products resulting from industry excess capacity, currency fluctuations, competitive actions, or other factors, particularly for electric vehicles; \\n Inflationary pressure and fluctuations in commodity and energy prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and market value of Ford or Ford Credit s investments, including marketable securities, can have a significant effect on results; \\n Ford and Ford Credit s access to debt, securitization, or derivative markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts could be affected by credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, regulatory requirements, or other factors; \\n The impact of government incentives on Ford s business could be significant, and Ford s receipt of government incentives could be subject to reduction, termination, or clawback; \\n Ford Credit could experience higher-than-expected credit losses, lower-than-anticipated residual values, or higher-than-expected return volumes for leased vehicles; \\n Economic and demographic experience for pension and OPEB plans (e.g., discount rates or investment returns) could be worse than Ford has assumed; \\n Pension and other postretirement liabilities could adversely affect Ford s liquidity and financial condition; \\n Ford and Ford Credit could experience unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations, or adverse publicity arising out of alleged defects in products, services, perceived environmental impacts, or otherwise; \\n Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations; \\n Ford and Ford Credit could be affected by the continued development of more stringent privacy, data use, data protection, and artificial intelligence laws and regulations as well as consumers heightened expectations to safeguard their personal information; and \\n Ford Credit could be subject to new or increased credit regulations, consumer protection regulations, or other regulations. \\n 73 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n We cannot be certain that any expectation, forecast, or assumption made in preparing forward-looking statements will prove accurate, or that any projection will be realized. It is to be expected that there may be differences between projected and actual results. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of their initial issuance, and we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. For additional discussion, see Item 1A. Risk Factors above. \\n 74 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT SUPPLEMENT GAAP MEASURES \\n \\n We use both generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for operational and financial decision making, and to assess Company and segment business performance. The non-GAAP measures listed below are intended to be considered by users as supplemental information to their equivalent GAAP measures, to aid investors in better understanding our financial results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful perspective on underlying operating results and trends, and a means to compare our period-over-period results. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in items or events being adjusted. \\n \\n Company Adjusted EBIT (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Income/(Loss) Attributable to Ford) Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) excludes interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), taxes, and pre-tax special items. This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it focuses on underlying operating results and trends, and improves comparability of our period-over-period results. Our management ordinarily excludes special items from its review of the results of the operating segments for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources. Our categories of pre-tax special items and the applicable significance guideline for each item (which may consist of a group of items related to a single event or action) are as follows: \\n \\n Pre-Tax Special Item Significance Guideline Pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses No minimum Gains and losses on investments in equity securities No minimum Personnel expenses, supplier- and dealer-related costs, and facility-related charges stemming from our efforts to match production capacity and cost structure to market demand and changing model mix Generally 100 million or more Other items that we do not necessarily consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities 500 million or more for individual field service actions; generally 100 million or more for other items \\n \\n When we provide guidance for adjusted EBIT, we do not provide guidance on a net income basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty, including gains and losses on pension and OPEB remeasurements and on investments in equity securities. \\n \\n Company Adjusted EBIT Margin (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Company Net Income/(Loss) Margin) Company Adjusted EBIT margin is Company adjusted EBIT divided by Company revenue. This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it allows users to evaluate our operating results aligned with industry reporting. \\n \\n Adjusted Earnings/(Loss) Per Share (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Earnings/(Loss) Per Share) Measure of Company s diluted net earnings/(loss) per share adjusted for impact of pre-tax special items (described above), tax special items, and restructuring impacts in noncontrolling interests. The measure provides investors with useful information to evaluate performance of our business excluding items not indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities. When we provide guidance for adjusted earnings/(loss) per share, we do not provide guidance on an earnings/(loss) per share basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses. \\n \\n Adjusted Effective Tax Rate (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Effective Tax Rate) Measure of Company s tax rate excluding pre-tax special items (described above) and tax special items. The measure provides an ongoing effective rate which investors find useful for historical comparisons and for forecasting. When we provide guidance for adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide guidance on an effective tax rate basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses. \\n 75 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Company Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Cash Provided By/(Used In) Operating Activities) Measure of Company s operating cash flow excluding Ford Credit s operating cash flows. The measure contains elements management considers operating activities, including Company excluding Ford Credit capital spending, Ford Credit distributions to its parent, and settlement of derivatives. The measure excludes cash outflows for funded pension contributions, restructuring actions, and other items that are considered operating cash flows under U.S. GAAP. This measure is useful to management and investors because it is consistent with management s assessment of the Company s operating cash flow performance. When we provide guidance for Company adjusted free cash flow, we do not provide guidance for net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities because the GAAP measure will include items that are difficult to quantify or predict with reasonable certainty, including cash flows related to the Company's exposures to foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices (separate from any related hedges), Ford Credit's operating cash flows, and cash flows related to special items, including separation payments, each of which individually or in the aggregate could have a significant impact to our net cash provided by/(used in) our operating activities. \\n \\n Adjusted ROIC Calculated as the sum of adjusted net operating profit/(loss) after cash tax from the last four quarters, divided by the average invested capital over the last four quarters. Adjusted Return on Invested Capital Adjusted ROIC provides management and investors with useful information to evaluate the Company s after-cash tax operating return on its invested capital for the period presented. Adjusted net operating profit/(loss) after cash tax measures operating results less special items, interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), and certain pension/OPEB costs. Average invested capital is the sum of average balance sheet equity, debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), and net pension/OPEB liability. \\n 76 \\n\\nItem 7.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \\n\\nWe consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. \\n \\n Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. \\n \\n Warranties and Field Service Actions \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required. We provide base warranties on the products we sell for specific periods of time and/or mileage, which vary depending upon the type of product and the geographic location of its sale. Separately, we also periodically perform field service actions related to safety recalls, emission recalls, and other product campaigns. Pursuant to these warranties and field service actions, we will repair, replace, or adjust parts on a vehicle that are defective in factory-supplied materials or workmanship. We accrue the estimated cost of both base warranty coverages and field service actions at the time of sale. In addition, from time to time, we issue extended warranties at our expense, the estimated cost of which is accrued at the time of issuance. \\n \\n Assumptions and Approach Used. We establish our estimate of base warranty obligations using a patterned estimation model. We use historical information regarding the nature, frequency, and average cost of claims for each vehicle line by model year. We reevaluate our estimate of base warranty obligations on a regular basis. Experience has shown that initial data for any given model year may be volatile; therefore, our process relies on long-term historical averages until sufficient data are available. With actual experience, we use the data to update the historical averages. We then compare the resulting accruals with present spending rates to assess whether the balances are adequate to meet expected future obligations. Based on this data, we update our estimates as necessary. \\n \\n Field service actions may occur in periods beyond the base warranty coverage period. We establish our estimates of field service action obligations using a patterned estimation model. We use historical information regarding the nature, frequency, severity, and average cost of claims for each model year. We assess our obligation for field service actions on a regular basis using actual claims experience and update our estimates as necessary. \\n \\n Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors used in establishing our estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 25 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for information regarding warranty and field service action costs. \\n \\n Pensions and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required. The estimation of our defined benefit pension and OPEB plan obligations and expenses requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events, such as demographic experience and health care cost increases. Plan obligations and expenses are based on existing retirement plan provisions. No assumption is made regarding any potential future changes to benefit provisions beyond those to which we are presently committed (e.g., in existing labor contracts). \\n 83 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Assumptions and Approach Used. The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: \\n \\n Discount rates. Our discount rate assumptions are based primarily on the results of cash flow matching analyses, which match the future cash outflows for each major plan to a yield curve based on high-quality bonds specific to the country of the plan. Benefit payments are discounted at the rates on the curve to determine the year-end obligations. \\n \\n Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Our expected long-term rate of return considers inputs from a range of advisors for capital market returns, adjusted for specific aspects of our investment strategy by plan. Historical returns also are considered when appropriate. The assumption is based on consideration of all inputs, with a focus on long-term trends to avoid short-term market influences. \\n \\n Salary growth. Our salary growth assumption reflects our actual experience, long-term outlook, and assumed inflation. \\n \\n Inflation. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators, including real gross domestic product growth and central bank inflation targets. \\n \\n Expected contributions. Our expected amount and timing of contributions are based on an assessment of minimum requirements, cash availability, and other considerations (e.g., funded status, avoidance of regulatory premiums and levies, and tax efficiency). \\n \\n Retirement rates. Retirement rates are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience. \\n \\n Mortality rates. Mortality rates are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience. \\n \\n Health care cost trends . Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook, and an assessment of likely long-term trends. \\n \\n Assumptions are set at each year-end and are generally not changed during the year unless there is a major plan event, such as a curtailment or settlement that would trigger a plan remeasurement. \\n \\n See Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding pension and OPEB costs and assumptions. \\n \\n Pension Plans \\n \\n Effect of Actual Results . The year-end 2023 weighted average discount rate was 5.17 for U.S. plans and 3.98 for non-U.S. plans, reflecting decreases of 34 and 44 basis points, respectively, compared with year-end 2022. In 2023, the U.S. actual return on assets was 7.41 , which was higher than the expected long-term rate of return of 6.25 . Non-U.S. actual return on assets was 5.56 , which was higher than the expected long-term rate of return of 4.13 . The higher returns are explained primarily by gains on fixed income assets. In total, lower discount rates compared to year-end 2022, partially offset by asset gains in excess of our assumptions resulted in a net remeasurement loss of 1.8 billion, which has been recognized within net periodic benefit cost and reported as a special item. \\n \\n For 2024, the expected long-term rate of return on assets is 5.93 for U.S. plans, down 32 basis points from 2023, reflecting lower capital market return expectations, and 4.53 for non-U.S. plans, up 40 basis points compared with a year ago, reflecting return expectations in those markets and a higher return seeking mix for certain plans. \\n \\n De-risking Strategy . We employ a broad de-risking strategy for our global funded plans that increases the matching characteristics of our assets relative to our obligation as funded status improves. Changes in interest rates, which directly influence changes in discount rates, in addition to other factors have a significant impact on the value of our pension obligation and fixed income asset portfolio. Our de-risking strategy has increased the allocation to fixed income investments and reduced our funded status sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates should result in offsetting effects in the value of our pension obligation and the value of the fixed income asset portfolio. \\n 84 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Sensitivity Analysis. The December 31, 2023 pension funded status and 2024 expense are affected by year-end 2023 assumptions. Sensitivities to these assumptions may be asymmetric and are specific to the time periods noted. The effects of changes in the factors that generally have the largest impact on year-end funded status and pension expense are discussed below. \\n \\n Discount rates and interest rates have the largest impact on our obligations and fixed income assets. The table below estimates the effect on our funded status of an increase/decrease in discount rates and interest rates (in millions): Basis Point Change Increase/(Decrease) in \\n December 31, 2023 Funded Status \\n Factor U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans Discount rate - obligation +/- 100 bps 2,900/ (3,400) 2,700/ (3,400) Interest rate - fixed income assets +/- 100 (2,800)/3,200 (1,800)/2,200 Net impact on funded status 100/ (200) 900/ (1,200) \\n \\n The fixed income asset sensitivity shown excludes other fixed income return components (e.g., changes in credit spreads, bond coupon and active management excess returns), and growth asset returns. Other factors that affect net funded status (e.g., contributions) are not reflected. \\n \\n Interest rates and the expected long-term rate of return on assets have the largest effect on pension expense. These assumptions are generally set at each year-end for expense recorded throughout the following year. The table below estimates the effect on pension expense of a higher/lower assumption for these factors (in millions): Basis Point Change Increase/(Decrease) in 2024 Pension Expense Factor U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans Interest rate - service cost and interest cost +/- 25 bps 25/ (25) 15/ (15) Expected long-term rate of return on assets +/- 25 (75)/75 (55)/55 \\n \\n The effect of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities. The sensitivity of pension expense to a change in discount rate assumptions may not be linear. \\n \\n Other Postretirement Employee Benefits \\n \\n Effect of Actual Results . The weighted average discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation for worldwide OPEB plans at December 31, 2023 was 5.10 , compared with 5.48 at December 31, 2022, resulting in a worldwide net remeasurement loss of 286 million, which has been recognized within net periodic benefit cost and reported as a special item. \\n \\n Sensitivity Analysis. Discount rates and interest rates have the largest effect on our OPEB obligation and expense. The table below estimates the effect on 2024 OPEB expense of higher/lower assumptions for these factors (in millions): Worldwide OPEB Basis Point Change (Increase)/Decrease 2023 YE Obligation Increase/(Decrease) 2024 Expense Factor Discount rate - obligation +/- 100 bps 450/ (540) N/A Interest rate - service cost and interest cost +/- 25 N/A 5/ (5) \\n \\n Income Taxes \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required. We must make estimates and apply judgment in determining the provision for income taxes for financial reporting purposes. We make these estimates and judgments primarily in the following areas: (i) the calculation of tax credits, (ii) the calculation of differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax reporting and financial statement purposes, as well as (iii) the calculation of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Changes in these estimates and judgments may result in a material increase or decrease to our tax provision, which would be recorded in the period in which the change occurs. \\n 85 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Assumptions and Approach Used. We are subject to the income tax laws and regulations of the many jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws and regulations are complex and involve uncertainties in the application to our facts and circumstances that may be open to interpretation. We recognize benefits for these uncertain tax positions based upon a process that requires judgment regarding the technical application of the laws, regulations, and various related judicial opinions. If, in our judgment, it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50 that the uncertain tax position will be settled favorably for us, we estimate an amount that ultimately will be realized. This process is inherently subjective since it requires our assessment of the probability of future outcomes. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis, including consideration of changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial opinions, as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. Changes to our estimate of the amount to be realized are recorded in our provision for income taxes during the period in which the change occurred. \\n \\n We must also assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income and reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized. \\n \\n This assessment, which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis, takes into account various types of evidence, including the following: \\n \\n Nature, frequency, and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses. A pattern of objectively measured recent financial reporting losses is heavily weighted as a source of negative evidence. We generally consider cumulative pre-tax losses in the three-year period ending with the current quarter to be significant negative evidence regarding future profitability. We also consider the strength and trend of earnings, as well as other relevant factors. In certain circumstances, historical information may not be as relevant due to changes in our business operations; \\n \\n Sources of future taxable income. Future reversals of existing temporary differences are heavily weighted sources of objectively verifiable positive evidence. Projections of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences are a source of positive evidence only when the projections are combined with a history of recent profits and can be reasonably estimated. Otherwise, these projections are considered inherently subjective and generally will not be sufficient to overcome negative evidence that includes relevant cumulative losses in recent years, particularly if the projected future taxable income is dependent on an anticipated turnaround to profitability that has not yet been achieved. In such cases, we generally give these projections of future taxable income no weight for the purposes of our valuation allowance assessment; and \\n \\n Tax planning strategies. If necessary and available, tax planning strategies could be implemented to accelerate taxable amounts to utilize expiring carryforwards. These strategies would be a source of additional positive evidence and, depending on their nature, could be heavily weighted. \\n \\n In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider the trade-offs between cash preservation and cash outlays to preserve tax credits. We presently believe that global valuation allowances of 4.2 billion are required and that we ultimately will recover the remaining 16 billion of deferred tax assets. However, the ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets is subject to a number of variables, including our future profitability within relevant tax jurisdictions, and future tax planning and the related effects on our cash and liquidity position. Accordingly, our valuation allowances may increase or decrease in future periods. \\n \\n For additional information regarding income taxes, see Note 7 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. \\n 86 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Impairment of Long-Lived Assets \\n \\n Asset groups are tested at the level of the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Asset groupings for impairment analysis are reevaluated when events occur, such as changes in organizational structure and management reporting. Following the organizational and segment structure change in the beginning of 2023, our asset groups are: Ford Blue North America, Ford Blue Europe, Ford Blue Rest of World, Ford Model e, Ford Pro, Ford Credit, and Ford Next. \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required - Held-and-Used Long-Lived Assets. We test our long-lived asset groups when changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable. Events that trigger a test for recoverability include material adverse changes in projected revenues or expenses, present cash flow losses combined with a history of cash flow losses and a forecast that demonstrates significant continuing losses, significant negative industry or economic trends (including a substantial shift in consumer preference), a current expectation that a long-lived asset group will be disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life, a significant adverse change in the manner in which an asset group is used or in its physical condition, or when there is a change in the asset grouping. In addition, investing in new, emerging products (e.g., EVs) or services (e.g., connectivity) may require substantial upfront investment, which may result in initial forecasted negative cash flows in the near term. In these instances, near-term negative cash flows on their own may not be indicative of a triggering event for evaluation of impairment. In such circumstances, we also conduct a qualitative evaluation of the business growth trajectory, which includes updating our assessment of when positive cash flows are expected to be generated, confirming whether established milestones are being achieved, and assessing our ability and intent to continue to access required funding to execute the plan. If this evaluation indicates a triggering event has occurred, a test for recoverability is performed. \\n \\n When a triggering event occurs, a test for recoverability is performed, comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group. If the undiscounted forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, the asset group s fair value is measured relying primarily on a discounted cash flow method. To the extent available, we will also consider third-party valuations of our long-lived assets that were prepared for other business purposes. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value. When an impairment loss is recognized for assets to be held and used, the adjusted carrying amounts of those assets are depreciated over their remaining useful life. \\n \\n Assumptions and Approach Used - Held-and-Used Long-Lived Assets. The fair value of an asset group is determined from the perspective of a market-participant considering, among other things, appropriate discount rates, valuation techniques, the most advantageous market, and assumptions about the highest and best use of the asset group. \\n \\n We measure the fair value of an asset group based on market prices (i.e., the amount for which the asset could be sold to a third party) when available. When market prices are not available, we generally estimate the fair value of the asset group using the income approach and/or the market approach. The income approach uses cash flow projections. Inherent in our development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results, business plan forecasts, expected growth rates, and cost of capital, similar to those a market participant would use to assess fair value. We also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions and other data. Many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management, and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods. \\n \\n Changes in assumptions or estimates can materially affect the fair value measurement of an asset group and, therefore, can affect the test results. The following are key assumptions we use in making cash flow projections: \\n \\n Business projections. We make assumptions about the demand for our products in the marketplace. These \\n assumptions drive our planning assumptions for volume, mix, and pricing. We also make assumptions about our cost levels (e.g., capacity utilization, cost performance). These projections are derived using our internal business plan forecasts that are updated at least annually and reviewed by our Board of Directors. \\n \\n Long-term growth rate. A growth rate is used to calculate the terminal value of the business and is added to the present value of the debt-free interim cash flows. The growth rate is the expected rate at which an asset group s earnings stream is projected to grow beyond the planning period. \\n \\n Discount rate. When measuring possible impairment, future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted-average cost of capital that we anticipate a potential market participant would use. Weighted-average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall risk-adjusted pre-tax rate of return expected by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise. \\n 87 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Economic projections. Assumptions regarding general economic conditions are included in and affect our assumptions regarding industry sales and pricing estimates for our vehicles. These macroeconomic assumptions include, but are not limited to, industry sales volumes, inflation, interest rates, prices of raw materials (e.g., commodities), and foreign currency exchange rates. \\n \\n The market approach is another method for measuring the fair value of an asset group. This approach relies on the market value (i.e., market capitalization) of companies that are engaged in the same or a similar line of business as the asset group being evaluated. In addition, to the extent available we also consider third-party valuations that were prepared for other business purposes. \\n \\n During 2023, we identified triggering events related to our Ford Blue Europe asset group. In each situation in which we experienced a triggering event during the year, we tested our long-lived assets for impairment using our internal economic and business projections, and determined that the carrying values of the long-lived assets were recoverable. If, in future quarters, our economic or business projections were to change as a result of an update to our plans, a deterioration of the economic or business environment, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used, or an expectation that a long-lived asset group will be disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life, we would undertake additional testing, as appropriate, which could result in an impairment of long-lived assets. \\n\\nAllowance for Credit Losses \\n \\n The allowance for credit losses represents Ford Credit s estimate of the expected lifetime credit losses inherent in finance receivables as of the balance sheet date. The adequacy of Ford Credit s allowance for credit losses is assessed quarterly, and the assumptions and models used in establishing the allowance are evaluated regularly. Because credit losses can vary substantially over time, estimating credit losses requires a number of assumptions about matters that are uncertain. Changes in assumptions affect Ford Credit interest, operating, and other expenses on our consolidated income statements and the allowance for credit losses contained within Ford Credit finance receivables, net on our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding allowance for credit losses. \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required. Ford Credit estimates the allowance for credit losses for receivables that share similar risk characteristics based on a collective assessment using a combination of measurement models and management judgment. The models consider factors such as historical trends in credit losses, recent portfolio performance, and forward-looking macroeconomic conditions. The models vary by portfolio and receivable type including consumer finance receivables, wholesale loans, and dealer loans. If Ford Credit does not believe the models reflect lifetime expected credit losses for the portfolio, an adjustment is made to reflect management judgment regarding qualitative factors, including economic uncertainty, observable changes in portfolio performance, and other relevant factors. \\n\\n88 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Assumptions Used. Ford Credit s allowance for credit losses is based on its assumptions regarding: \\n \\n Probability of default . The expected probability of payment and time to default, which include assumptions about macroeconomic factors and recent performance; and \\n Loss given default. The percentage of the expected balance due at default that is not recoverable. The loss given default takes into account expected collateral value and future recoveries. \\n \\n Macroeconomic factors used in Ford Credit s models are country specific and include variables such as unemployment rates, personal bankruptcy filings, housing prices, and gross domestic product. \\n \\n Sensitivity Analysis. Changes in the probability of default and loss given default assumptions would affect the allowance for credit losses. The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions for Ford Credit s U.S. Ford and Lincoln retail financing is as follows (in millions): Assumption Basis Point Change \\n Increase/(Decrease) Probability of default (lifetime) +/- 100 bps 230/ (230) Loss given default +/- 100 10/(10) \\n \\n Accumulated Depreciation on Vehicles Subject to Operating Leases \\n \\n Accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases reduces the value of the leased vehicles in Ford Credit s operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their expected residual value at the end of the lease term. \\n \\n Ford Credit monitors residual values each month, and it reviews the adequacy of accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis. If Ford Credit believes that the expected residual values for its vehicles have changed, it revises depreciation to ensure that net investment in operating leases (equal to the acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation) will be adjusted to reflect Ford Credit s revised estimate of the expected residual value at the end of the lease term. Adjustments to depreciation expense result in a change in the depreciation rates of the vehicles subject to operating leases and are recorded prospectively on a straight-line basis. \\n \\n Generally, lease customers have the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer. \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required. Each operating lease in Ford Credit s portfolio represents a vehicle it owns that has been leased to a customer. At the time Ford Credit purchases a lease, it establishes an expected residual value for the vehicle. Ford Credit estimates the expected residual value by evaluating recent auction values, return volumes for its leased vehicles, industrywide used vehicle prices, marketing incentive plans, and vehicle quality data. \\n \\n Assumptions Used. Ford Credit s accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases is based on assumptions regarding: \\n \\n Auction value. Ford Credit s projection of the market value of the vehicles when sold at the end of the lease; and \\n Return volume. Ford Credit s projection of the number of vehicles that will be returned at lease-end. \\n \\n See Note 12 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases. \\n\\n89 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Sensitivity Analysis. For returned vehicles, Ford Credit faces a risk that the amount it obtains from the vehicle sold at auction will be less than its estimate of the expected residual value for the vehicle. The impact of the change in assumptions on future auction values and return volumes would increase or decrease accumulated supplemental depreciation and depreciation expense over the remaining terms of the operating leases; however, the impact may be tempered or exacerbated based on future auction values in relation to the purchase price specified in the lease contract. A change in the assumption for an auction value will impact Ford Credit s estimate of accumulated supplemental depreciation if the future auction value is lower than the purchase price specified in the lease contract. The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions for Ford Credit s U.S. Ford and Lincoln operating lease portfolio is as follows (in millions): Assumption Basis Point \\n Change \\n Increase/(Decrease) Future auction values +/- 100 bps (20)/ 20 Return volumes +/- 100 5/(5) \\n \\n Adjustments to the amount of accumulated supplemental depreciation on operating leases are reflected on our balance sheets as Net investment in operating leases and on our income statements in Ford Credit interest, operating, and other expenses. \\n\\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS ISSUED BUT NOT YET ADOPTED \\n \\n For a discussion of recent accounting standards, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. \\n \\n 90  \n",
       "1  ITEM 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \\n\\nKey Trends and Economic Factors Affecting Ford and the Automotive Industry \\n \\n COVID-19 and Supplier Disruptions. The impact of COVID-19, including changes in consumer behavior, pandemic fears and market downturns, and restrictions on business and individual activities, has created significant volatility in the global economy. Outbreaks in certain regions continue to cause intermittent COVID-19-related disruptions in our supply chain and local manufacturing operations. We also continue to face supplier disruptions due to labor shortages and other production issues, in addition to the continuing semiconductor shortage. Our inconsistent production schedule has been disruptive to our suppliers operations, which, in turn, has led to higher costs and production shortfalls. Further, actions taken by Russia in Ukraine have impacted and could further impact our suppliers, particularly our lower tier suppliers, as well as our operations in Europe. For additional information on the impact of supplier disruptions, see the Outlook section on page 73 . \\n \\n Currency Exchange Rate Volatility. After aggressively easing monetary policy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve, and other central banks around the world, in 2022 began to withdraw monetary stimulus by raising interest rates. Periods of monetary policy tightening are often associated with heightened financial market and currency volatility, especially for those markets that are outliers in terms of their economic or monetary policy backdrop. This is notable for many emerging markets, which may also face increased exposure to commodity prices and political instability, contributing to unpredictable movements in the value of their exchange rates. In addition to direct impacts on the financial flows of global automotive companies, currency movements can also impact pricing of vehicles exported to overseas markets. In most markets, exchange rates are market-determined, and all are impacted by many different macroeconomic and policy factors, and thus likely to remain volatile. However, in some markets, exchange rates are heavily influenced or controlled by governments. \\n \\n Pricing Pressure. Over the last year, prices of both new and used vehicles have increased substantially due to strong demand, supply shortages, and inflationary costs. We have already observed some moderation in the rate of price increases as auto production slowly recovers from the semiconductor shortage, but it is unclear whether prices will decline fully to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. Over the long term, intense competition and excess capacity are likely to put downward pressure on inflation-adjusted prices for similarly-contented vehicles and contribute to a challenging pricing environment for the automotive industry in most major markets. \\n \\n Commodity and Energy Prices. Prices for commodities remain volatile. In some cases, spot prices for various commodities have recently diverged somewhat, as anticipated weakening in global industrial activity mitigates price increases for base metals such as steel and aluminum, while precious metals (e.g., palladium), and raw materials that are used in batteries for electric vehicles (e.g., lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, among other materials, for batteries) remain high. The net impact on us and our suppliers has been higher material costs overall. To help ensure supply of raw materials for critical components (e.g., batteries), we, like others in the industry, have entered into multi-year sourcing agreements and may enter into additional agreements. Similar dynamics are impacting energy markets, with Europe particularly exposed to the risk of both higher prices and constraints on supply of natural gas due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Such shortages may impact facilities operated by us or our suppliers, which could have an impact on us in Europe and other regions. In the long term, the outcome of de-carbonization and electrification of the vehicle fleet may depress oil demand, but the global energy transition will also contribute to ongoing volatility of oil and other energy prices. For additional information on commodity costs, see the Outlook section on page 73 . \\n \\n Vehicle Profitability. Our financial results depend on the profitability of the vehicles we sell, which may vary significantly by vehicle line. In general, larger vehicles tend to command higher prices and be more profitable than smaller vehicles, both across and within vehicle segments. For example, in North America, our larger, more profitable vehicles had an average contribution margin that was 120 of our total average contribution margin across all vehicles, whereas our smaller vehicles had significantly lower contribution margins. In addition, government regulations aimed at reducing emissions and increasing fuel efficiency (e.g., ZEV mandates and low emission zones), and other factors that accelerate the transition to electrified vehicles, may increase the cost of vehicles by more than the perceived benefit to consumers and dampen margins. \\n\\n35 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Trade Policy. To the extent governments in various regions implement or intensify barriers to imports, such as erecting tariff or non-tariff barriers or manipulating their currency, and provide advantages to local exporters selling into the global marketplace, there can be a significant negative impact on manufacturers based in other markets. While we believe the long-term trend will support the growth of free trade, we will continue to monitor and address developing issues. \\n \\n Inflation and Interest Rates. We continue to see near-term impacts on our business due to inflation, including ongoing global price pressures in the wake of Russia s invasion of Ukraine, driving up energy prices, freight premiums, and other operating costs above normal rates. Although headline inflation in the United States and Europe appears to have peaked, as gasoline and natural gas prices recede from the latest spike, core inflation (excluding food and energy prices) remains elevated and is a source of continued cost pressure on businesses and households. Interest rates have increased significantly as central banks in developed countries attempt to subdue inflation while government deficits and debt remain at high levels in many global markets. Accordingly, the eventual implications of higher government deficits and debt, tighter monetary policy, and potentially higher long-term interest rates may drive a higher cost of capital for the business. At Ford Credit, rising interest rates may impact its ability to source funding and offer financing at competitive rates, which could reduce its financing margin. \\n \\n Revenue \\n \\n Our Automotive segment revenue is generated primarily by sales of vehicles, parts, and accessories. Revenue is recorded when control is transferred to our customers (generally, our dealers and distributors). For the majority of sales, this occurs when products are shipped from our manufacturing facilities. However, we defer a portion of the consideration received when there is a separate future or stand-ready performance obligation, such as extended service contracts or ongoing vehicle connectivity. Revenue related to extended service contracts is recognized over the term of the agreement in proportion to the costs we expect to incur in satisfying the contract obligations; revenue related to other future or stand-ready performance obligations is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the period in which services are expected to be performed. Vehicles sold to daily rental car companies with an obligation to repurchase for a guaranteed amount, exercisable at the option of the customer, are accounted for as operating leases, with lease revenue recognized over the term of the lease. Proceeds from the sale of vehicles at auction are recognized in revenue upon transfer of control of the vehicle to the buyer. \\n \\n Most of the vehicles sold by us to our dealers and distributors are financed at wholesale by Ford Credit. Upon Ford Credit originating the wholesale receivable related to a dealer s purchase of a vehicle, Ford Credit pays cash to the relevant Automotive legal entity in payment of the dealer s obligation for the purchase price of the vehicle. The dealer then pays the wholesale finance receivable to Ford Credit when it sells the vehicle to a retail customer. \\n \\n Our Ford Credit segment revenue is generated primarily from interest on finance receivables and revenue from operating leases. Revenue from interest on finance receivables is recognized over the term of the receivable using the interest method and includes the amortization of certain deferred origination costs. Revenue from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. \\n \\n Transactions between our Automotive and Ford Credit segments occur in the ordinary course of business. For example, we offer special retail financing and lease incentives to dealers customers who choose to finance or lease our vehicles from Ford Credit. The cost for these incentives is included in our estimate of variable consideration at the date the related vehicle sales to our dealers are recorded. In order to compensate Ford Credit for the lower interest or lease payments offered to the retail customer, we pay the discounted value of the incentive directly to Ford Credit when it originates the retail finance or lease contract with the dealer s customer. Ford Credit recognizes the incentive amount over the life of retail finance contracts as an element of financing revenue and over the life of lease contracts as a reduction to depreciation. See Note 1 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of transactions between our Automotive and Ford Credit segments. \\n\\n36 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Costs and Expenses \\n \\n Our income statement classifies our Company excluding Ford Credit total costs and expenses into two categories: (i) cost of sales, and (ii) selling, administrative, and other expenses. We include within cost of sales those costs related to the development, production, and distribution of our vehicles, parts, accessories, and services. Specifically, we include in cost of sales each of the following: material costs (including commodity costs); freight costs; warranty, including product recall costs; labor and other costs related to the development and production of our vehicles and connectivity, parts, accessories, and services; depreciation and amortization; and other associated costs. We include within selling, administrative, and other expenses labor and other costs not directly related to the development and production of our vehicles, parts, accessories, and services, including such expenses as advertising and sales promotion costs. \\n \\n Certain of our costs, such as material costs, generally vary directly with changes in volume and mix of production. In our industry, production volume often varies significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. Quarterly production volumes experience seasonal shifts throughout the year (including peak retail sales seasons and the impact on production of model changeover and new product launches). Annual production volumes are heavily impacted by external economic factors, including the pace of economic growth and factors such as the availability of consumer credit and cost of fuel. \\n \\n As a result, we analyze the profit impact of certain cost changes holding constant present-year volume and mix and currency exchange, in order to evaluate our cost trends absent the impact of varying production and currency exchange levels. We analyze these cost changes in the following categories: \\n \\n Contribution Costs these costs typically vary with production volume. These costs include material (including commodity), warranty, and freight and duty costs. \\n \\n Structural Costs these costs typically do not have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume. These costs include manufacturing; vehicle and software engineering; spending-related; advertising and sales promotion; administrative, information technology, and selling; and pension and OPEB costs. \\n \\n While contribution costs generally vary directly in proportion to production volume, elements within our structural costs category are impacted to differing degrees by changes in production volume. We also have varying degrees of discretion when it comes to controlling the different elements within our structural costs. For example, depreciation and amortization expense largely is associated with prior capital spending decisions. On the other hand, while labor costs do not vary directly with production volume, manufacturing labor costs may be impacted by changes in volume, for example when we increase overtime, add a production shift, or add personnel to support volume increases. Other structural costs, such as advertising or engineering costs, do not necessarily have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume. Our structural costs generally are within our discretion, although to varying degrees, and can be adjusted over time in response to external factors. \\n \\n We consider certain structural costs to be a direct investment in future growth and revenue. For example, structural costs are necessary to grow our business and improve profitability, invest in new products and technologies, respond to increasing industry sales volume, and grow our market share. \\n \\n Cost of sales and Selling, administrative, and other expenses for full year 2022 were 145.3 billion. Our Automotive segment s material and commodity costs make up the largest portion of these costs and expenses, followed by structural costs. Although material costs are our largest absolute cost, our margins can be affected significantly by changes in any category of costs. \\n 37 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 2022 \\n \\n The net loss attributable to Ford Motor Company was 1,981 million in 2022. Company adjusted EBIT was 10,415 million. \\n \\n Net income/(loss) includes certain items special items that are excluded from Company adjusted EBIT. These items are discussed in more detail in Note 26 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. We report special items separately to allow investors analyzing our results to identify certain infrequent significant items that they may wish to exclude when considering the trend of ongoing operating results. Our pre-tax and tax special items were as follows (in millions): \\n 2021 2022 Global Redesign Europe (530) (151) India (468) (298) South America (803) 53 China (including Taiwan) 150 (380) North America (72) (198) Other 3 7 Subtotal Global Redesign (1,720) (967) Other Items Gain/(loss) on Rivian investment \\n 9,096 (7,377) Debt extinguishment premium (1,692) (135) AV strategy including Argo impairment (see Note 14) (2,812) Ford Credit Brazil restructuring (see Note 21) 14 (155) Russia suspension of operations/asset write-off (158) Patent matters related to prior calendar years (124) Other 82 (35) Subtotal Other Items 7,500 (10,796) Pension and OPEB Gain/(Loss) Pension and OPEB remeasurement 3,873 29 Pension settlements and curtailments (70) (438) Subtotal Pension and OPEB Gain/(Loss) 3,803 (409) Total EBIT Special Items 9,583 (12,172) Cash effect of Global Redesign (incl. separations) (1,935) (377) Provision for/(Benefit from) tax special items (a) (1,924) (2,573) \\n __________ \\n (a) Includes related tax effect on special items and tax special items. \\n \\n We recorded 12.2 billion of pre-tax special item charges in 2022, driven by a 7.4 billion mark-to-market net loss on our Rivian investment and a 2.7 billion impairment on our Argo investment. \\n \\n In Note 26 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, special items are reflected as a separate reconciling item, as opposed to being allocated among the Automotive, Mobility, and Ford Credit segments. This reflects the fact that management excludes these items from its review of operating segment results for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources. \\n 38 \\n\\nItem 7.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Definitions and Information Regarding Automotive Causal Factors \\n \\n In general, we measure year-over-year change in Automotive segment EBIT using the causal factors listed below, with net pricing and cost variances calculated at present-year volume and mix and exchange: \\n \\n Market Factors (exclude the impact of unconsolidated affiliate wholesale units): \\n Volume and Mix primarily measures EBIT variance from changes in wholesale unit volumes (at prior-year average contribution margin per unit) driven by changes in industry volume, market share, and dealer stocks, as well as the EBIT variance resulting from changes in product mix, including mix among vehicle lines and mix of trim levels and options within a vehicle line \\n Net Pricing primarily measures EBIT variance driven by changes in wholesale unit prices to dealers and marketing incentive programs such as rebate programs, low-rate financing offers, special lease offers, and stock adjustments on dealer inventory \\n \\n Cost: \\n Contribution Costs primarily measures EBIT variance driven by per-unit changes in cost categories that typically vary with volume, such as material costs (including commodity and component costs), warranty expense, and freight and duty costs \\n Structural Costs primarily measures EBIT variance driven by absolute change in cost categories that typically do not have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume. Structural costs include the following cost categories: \\n Manufacturing, Including Volume-Related - consists primarily of costs for hourly and salaried manufacturing personnel, plant overhead (such as utilities and taxes), and new product launch expense. These costs could be affected by volume for operating pattern actions such as overtime, line-speed, and shift schedules \\n Engineering and Connectivity consists primarily of costs for vehicle and software engineering personnel, prototype materials, testing, and outside engineering and software services \\n Spending-Related consists primarily of depreciation and amortization of our manufacturing and engineering assets, but also includes asset retirements and operating leases \\n Advertising and Sales Promotions includes costs for advertising, marketing programs, brand promotions, customer mailings and promotional events, and auto shows \\n Administrative, Information Technology, and Selling includes primarily costs for salaried personnel and purchased services related to our staff activities, information technology, and selling functions \\n Pension and OPEB consists primarily of past service pension costs and other postretirement employee benefit costs \\n \\n Exchange primarily measures EBIT variance driven by one or more of the following: (i) transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the relevant entities, (ii) effects of converting functional currency income to U.S. dollars, (iii) effects of remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities of the relevant entities in currencies other than their functional currency, or (iv) results of our foreign currency hedging \\n \\n Other includes a variety of items, such as parts and services earnings, royalties, government incentives, and compensation-related changes \\n \\n In addition, definitions and calculations used in this report include: \\n \\n Wholesales and Revenue wholesale unit volumes include all Ford and Lincoln badged units (whether produced by Ford or by an unconsolidated affiliate) that are sold to dealerships or others, units manufactured by Ford that are sold to other manufacturers, units distributed by Ford for other manufacturers, and local brand units produced by our China joint venture, Jiangling Motors Corporation, Ltd. JMC ), that are sold to dealerships or others. Vehicles sold to daily rental car companies that are subject to a guaranteed repurchase option (i.e., rental repurchase), as well as other sales of finished vehicles for which the recognition of revenue is deferred (e.g., consignments), also are included in wholesale unit volumes. Revenue from certain vehicles in wholesale unit volumes (specifically, Ford badged vehicles produced and distributed by our unconsolidated affiliates, as well as JMC brand vehicles) are not included in our revenue \\n \\n Industry Volume and Market Share based, in part, on estimated vehicle registrations; includes medium and heavy duty trucks \\n \\n SAAR seasonally adjusted annual rate \\n 45 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Mobility Segment \\n \\n The Mobility segment primarily includes development costs for Ford s autonomous vehicles and related businesses, Ford s equity ownership in Argo AI (a developer of autonomous driving systems), and other mobility businesses and investments. \\n \\n In our Mobility segment, our 2022 EBIT loss improved 104 million from a year ago. The 926 million EBIT loss reflects our strategic investments in our autonomous vehicle capabilities and support of our mobility initiatives. \\n \\n In the third quarter of 2022, we made the strategic decision to shift our capital spending from L4 technology being developed by Argo AI to advanced L2/L3 systems, which we believe will ultimately be essential to achieve profitable commercialization of L4 autonomy at scale in the future. Additionally, because of the significant additional capital and time required to achieve commercialization of L4, as well as other macroeconomic factors, Argo AI has been unable to attract new investors. After performing external outreach in the third quarter to assess market interest in acquiring either Argo AI or its technology components and conducting internal reviews to evaluate opportunities to leverage Argo AI s technology, Ford determined that Argo AI no longer has value as a going concern. As a result, we reassessed the carrying value of our investment in Argo AI starting from September 30, 2022, and in October, Ford and VW initiated the process of exiting the joint development of L4 technology through Argo AI. Accordingly, in the second half of 2022, we recorded as a special item a 2.7 billion pre-tax impairment on our Argo AI investment, and on October 26, 2022, we announced that Argo AI plans to wind down operations, which is in progress. \\n \\n 46 \\n\\nItem 7.

Ford Credit s loss metrics reflected healthy and stable consumer credit conditions and strong auction values. Ford Credit s U.S. 36-month auction values for off-lease vehicles were up 8 from a year ago, reflecting strong demand for used vehicles, including the impact of lower new vehicle production due to the semiconductor shortage. We are planning for full year 2023 auction values to decrease as supply constraints improve. \\n \\n Ford Credit s 2022 EBT of 2,657 million was 2,060 million lower than a year ago, reflecting lower credit loss and lease residual reserve releases, lower financing margin, and lower lease return rates. \\n \\n 47 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Definitions and Information Regarding Ford Credit Causal Factors \\n \\n In general, we measure year-over-year changes in Ford Credit s EBT using the causal factors listed below: \\n \\n Volume and Mix: \\n Volume primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by changes in average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses at prior period financing margin yield (defined below in financing margin) at prior period exchange rates. Volume changes are primarily driven by the volume of new and used vehicles sold and leased, the extent to which Ford Credit purchases retail financing and operating lease contracts, the extent to which Ford Credit provides wholesale financing, the sales price of the vehicles financed, the level of dealer inventories, Ford-sponsored special financing programs available exclusively through Ford Credit, and the availability of cost-effective funding \\n Mix primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by period-over-period changes in the composition of Ford Credit s average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses by product within each region \\n \\n Financing Margin: \\n Financing margin variance is the period-to-period change in financing margin yield multiplied by the present period average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses at prior period exchange rates. This calculation is performed at the product and country level and then aggregated. Financing margin yield equals revenue, less interest expense and scheduled depreciation for the period, divided by average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses for the same period \\n Financing margin changes are driven by changes in revenue and interest expense. Changes in revenue are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, cost assumptions in pricing, mix of business, and competitive environment. Changes in interest expense are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, borrowing spreads, and asset-liability management \\n \\n Credit Loss: \\n Credit loss is the change in the provision for credit losses at prior period exchange rates. For analysis purposes, management splits the provision for credit losses into net charge-offs and the change in the allowance for credit losses \\n Net charge-off changes are primarily driven by the number of repossessions, severity per repossession, and recoveries. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are primarily driven by changes in historical trends in credit losses and recoveries, changes in the composition and size of Ford Credit s present portfolio, changes in trends in historical used vehicle values, and changes in forward looking macroeconomic conditions. For additional information, refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates - Allowance for Credit Losses section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2022 Form 10-K Report \\n \\n Lease Residual: \\n Lease residual measures changes to residual performance at prior period exchange rates. For analysis purposes, management splits residual performance primarily into residual gains and losses, and the change in accumulated supplemental depreciation \\n Residual gain and loss changes are primarily driven by the number of vehicles returned to Ford Credit and sold, and the difference between the auction value and the depreciated value (which includes both base and accumulated supplemental depreciation) of the vehicles sold. Changes in accumulated supplemental depreciation are primarily driven by changes in Ford Credit s estimate of the expected auction value at the end of the lease term, and changes in Ford Credit s estimate of the number of vehicles that will be returned to it and sold. Depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases includes early termination losses on operating leases due to customer default events. For additional information, refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates - Accumulated Depreciation on Vehicles Subject to Operating Leases section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2022 Form 10-K Report \\n \\n Exchange: \\n Reflects changes in EBT driven by the effects of converting functional currency income to U.S. dollars \\n \\n Other: \\n Primarily includes operating expenses, other revenue, insurance expenses, and other income/(loss) at prior period exchange rates \\n Changes in operating expenses are primarily driven by salaried personnel costs, facilities costs, and costs associated with the origination and servicing of customer contracts \\n In general, other income/(loss) changes are primarily driven by changes in earnings related to market valuation adjustments to derivatives (primarily related to movements in interest rates) and other miscellaneous items \\n 48 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n In addition, the following definitions and calculations apply to Ford Credit when used in this Report: \\n \\n Cash (as shown in the Funding Structure and Liquidity tables) Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, excluding amounts related to insurance activities \\n \\n Debt (as shown in the Key Metrics and Leverage tables) Debt on Ford Credit s balance sheets. Includes debt issued in securitizations and payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets and related enhancements. Ford Credit holds the right to receive the excess cash flows not needed to pay the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions \\n \\n Earnings Before Taxes EBT Reflects Ford Credit s income before income taxes \\n \\n Loss-to-Receivables LTR Ratio LTR ratio is calculated using net charge-offs divided by average finance receivables, excluding unearned interest supplements and the allowance for credit losses \\n \\n Return on Equity ROE (as shown in the Key Metrics table) Reflects return on equity calculated by annualizing net income for the period and dividing by monthly average equity for the period \\n \\n Securitization and Restricted Cash (as shown in the Liquidity table) Securitization cash is held for the benefit of the securitization investors (for example, a reserve fund). Restricted cash primarily includes cash held to meet certain local governmental and regulatory reserve requirements and cash held under the terms of certain contractual agreements \\n \\n Securitizations (as shown in the Public Term Funding Plan table) Public securitization transactions, Rule 144A offerings sponsored by Ford Credit, and widely distributed offerings by Ford Credit Canada \\n \\n Term Asset-Backed Securities (as shown in the Funding Structure table) Obligations issued in securitization transactions that are payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets and related enhancements \\n \\n Total Net Receivables (as shown in the Key Metrics table) Includes finance receivables (retail financing and wholesale) sold for legal purposes and net investment in operating leases included in securitization transactions that do not satisfy the requirements for accounting sale treatment. These receivables and operating leases are reported on Ford Credit s balance sheets and are available only for payment of the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions; they are not available to pay the other obligations of Ford Credit or the claims of Ford Credit s other creditors \\n\\nCorporate Other \\n \\n Corporate Other primarily includes corporate governance expenses, interest income (excluding interest earned on our extended service contract portfolio that is included in our Automotive segment) and gains and losses from our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding gains and losses on investments in equity securities), and foreign exchange derivatives gains and losses associated with intercompany lending. Corporate governance expenses are primarily administrative, delivering benefit on behalf of the global enterprise, that are not allocated to operating segments. These include expenses related to setting and directing global policy, providing oversight and stewardship, and promoting the Company s interests. For full year 2022, Corporate Other had a 1,008 million loss, compared with a 1,084 million loss in 2021. The improvement was driven by higher Automotive interest income due to higher interest rates (primarily Fed Funds). \\n\\nInterest on Debt \\n \\n Interest on Debt consists of interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit. Our full year 2022 interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit was 1,259 million, 544 million lower than in 2021, primarily explained by U.S. debt restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2021 and during 2022. \\n \\n 49 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Taxes \\n \\n Our Provision for/(Benefit from) income taxes for full year 2022 was a 864 million benefit, resulting in an effective tax rate of 28.6 . This includes benefits arising from the reversal of U.S. valuation allowances, primarily as a result of planning actions. \\n \\n Our full year 2022 adjusted effective tax rate, which excludes special items, was 18.7 . \\n \\n We regularly review our organizational structure and income tax elections for affiliates in non-U.S. and U.S. tax jurisdictions, which may result in changes in affiliates that are included in or excluded from our U.S. tax return. Any future changes to our structure, as well as any changes in income tax laws in the countries that we operate, could cause increases or decreases to our deferred tax balances and related valuation allowances. \\n 50 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 2021 \\n \\n The net income attributable to Ford Motor Company was 17,937 million in 2021. Company adjusted EBIT was 10,000 million. \\n \\n Net income/(loss) includes certain items special items that are excluded from Company adjusted EBIT. These items are discussed in more detail in Note 26 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. We report special items separately to allow investors analyzing our results to identify certain infrequent significant items that they may wish to exclude when considering the trend of ongoing operating results. Our pre-tax and tax special items were as follows (in millions): \\n 2020 2021 Global Redesign Europe (727) (530) India (23) (468) South America (2,486) (803) Russia 18 5 China (including Taiwan) (56) 150 Separations and Other (not included above) (94) (74) Subtotal Global Redesign (3,368) (1,720) Other Items Gain on transaction with Argo AI 3,454 Gain on Rivian IPO and mark-to-market \\n 143 9,096 Gains and losses on investments in equity securities (excl.

The gains were partially offset by costs associated with our Global Redesign actions and a debt extinguishment premium associated with the repurchase and redemption of 7.6 billion of our higher-coupon debt. \\n \\n In Note 26 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, special items are reflected as a separate reconciling item, as opposed to being allocated among the Automotive, Mobility, and Ford Credit segments. This reflects the fact that management excludes these items from its review of operating segment results for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources. \\n 51 \\n\\nItem 7.

Ford Credit s loss metrics reflected healthy and stable consumer credit conditions and strong auction values. Ford Credit s U.S. 36-month auction values for off-lease vehicles were up 26 from 2020, reflecting strong demand for used vehicles, including the impact of lower new vehicle production due to the semiconductor shortage. \\n \\n Ford Credit s 2021 EBT increased 2,109 million from 2020, explained primarily by favorable operating lease residual performance, the non-recurrence of the 2020 increase to the credit loss reserve due to deterioration in macroeconomic conditions related to COVID-19, and reductions in the credit loss reserve in 2021, partially offset by lower volume driven by the impact of the global semiconductor shortage and lower financing margin. \\n 58 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Corporate Other \\n \\n For full year 2021, Corporate Other had a 1,084 million loss, compared with a 726 million loss in 2020. The higher loss was driven by lower interest income and higher administrative and IT-related expenses. \\n\\nInterest on Debt \\n \\n Our full year 2021 interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit was 1,803 million, 154 million higher than in 2020, primarily explained by higher U.S. unsecured debt interest expense. \\n\\nTaxes \\n \\n Our Provision for/(Benefit from) income taxes for full year 2021 was a 130 million benefit, resulting in an effective tax rate of negative 0.7 . This includes a benefit of 2.9 billion to recognize deferred tax assets resulting from changes in our global tax structure and a 918 million benefit from the reversal of U.S. valuation allowances. \\n \\n Our full year 2021 adjusted effective tax rate, which excludes special items, was 21.9 . \\n 59 \\n\\nItem 7.

One of our key priorities is to maintain a strong balance sheet, while at the same time having resources available to invest in and grow our business. At December 31, 2022, we had Company cash of 32.3 billion and liquidity of 48.0 billion, including approximately 194 million of Rivian marketable securities. In 2022, we sold approximately 91 million of our Rivian shares resulting in proceeds of about 3 billion. As marketable securities increase or decrease in value, Company cash and liquidity will likewise increase or decrease. At December 31, 2022, about 89 of Company cash was held by consolidated entities domiciled in the United States. \\n \\n To be prepared for an economic downturn, we target an ongoing Company cash balance at or above 20 billion plus significant additional liquidity above our Company cash target. We expect to have periods when we will be above or below this amount due to: (i) future cash flow expectations, such as for investments in future opportunities, capital investments, debt maturities, pension contributions, or restructuring requirements, (ii) short-term timing differences, and (iii) changes in the global economic environment. \\n \\n Our Company cash investments (excluding the Rivian marketable securities) primarily include U.S. Department of Treasury obligations, federal agency securities, bank time deposits with investment-grade institutions, investment-grade corporate securities, investment-grade commercial paper, and debt obligations of a select group of non-U.S. governments, non-U.S. governmental agencies, and supranational institutions. The average maturity of these investments is approximately one year and adjusted based on market conditions and liquidity needs. We monitor our Company cash levels and average maturity on a daily basis. \\n\\n60 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Material Cash Requirements. Our material cash requirements include: \\n \\n Capital expenditures (for additional information, see the Changes in Company Cash section below) and other payments for engineering, software, product development, and implementation of our plans for electric vehicles \\n \\n Purchase of raw materials and components to support the manufacturing and sale of vehicles (including electric vehicles), parts, and accessories (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table and the accompanying description of our Purchase obligations below) \\n \\n Marketing incentive payments to dealers \\n \\n Payments for warranty and field service actions (for additional information, see Note 25 of the Notes to the Financial Statements) \\n \\n Debt repayments (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table below and Note 19 of the Notes the Financial Statements) \\n \\n Discretionary and mandatory payments to our global pension plans (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table below, the Changes in Company Cash section below, and Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements) \\n \\n Employee wages, benefits, and incentives \\n \\n Operating lease payments (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table below and Note 18 of the Notes to the Financial Statements) \\n \\n Cash effects related to the global redesign of our business (for additional information, see the Changes in Company Cash section below) \\n \\n Strategic acquisitions and investments to grow our business, including electrification \\n \\n Subject to approval by our Board of Directors, shareholder distributions in the form of dividend payments and/or a share repurchase program (including share repurchases to offset the anti-dilutive effect of increased shared-based compensation) may require the expenditure of a material amount of cash. Moreover, we may be subject to additional material cash requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, e.g., legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions, and other matters. \\n \\n We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties, and, as noted above, such commitments require a material amount of cash. Most of these are debt obligations incurred by our Ford Credit segment. In addition, as part of our normal business practices, we enter into contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components, and services to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services. These arrangements, including multi-year offtake commitments, may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase requirements. Purchase obligations in the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table below are defined as off-balance sheet agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms; however, as we purchase raw materials and components beyond the minimum amounts required by the Purchase obligations, our material cash requirements for these items are higher than what is reflected in the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table. For additional information on the timing of these payments and the impact on our working capital, see the Changes in Company Cash section below. \\n 61 \\n\\nItem 7.

See Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for further information regarding our expected 2022 pension contributions and funded status. \\n (f) Purchase obligations under existing offtake agreements for scarce raw materials are not included in the table above. As of December 31, 2022, our forecasted expenditures for the maximum quantity that may be purchased under these offtake agreements, which are subject to satisfaction of the conditions in the agreements, total about 2.4 billion through 2029 based on our present pricing forecast; however, our forecasted prices could fluctuate significantly from period to period, which would result in volatility in the estimate of our overall obligation. In addition, we plan to continue to enter into offtake agreements with raw material suppliers, the costs under which we expect to be significant. \\n \\n We plan to utilize our liquidity (as described above) and our cash flows from business operations to fund our material cash requirements. \\n \\n Changes in Company Cash. In managing our business, we classify changes in Company cash into operating and non-operating items. Operating items include: Company adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit EBT, capital spending, depreciation and tooling amortization, changes in working capital, Ford Credit distributions, interest on debt, cash taxes, and all other and timing differences (including timing differences between accrual-based EBIT and associated cash flows). Non-operating items include: global redesign (including separation payments), changes in Company debt excluding Ford Credit, contributions to funded pension plans, shareholder distributions, and other items (including gains and losses on investments in equity securities, acquisitions and divestitures, equity investments, and other transactions with Ford Credit). \\n\\n62 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n With respect to Changes in working capital, in general we carry relatively low Automotive segment trade receivables compared with our trade payables because the majority of our Automotive wholesales are financed (primarily by Ford Credit) immediately upon the sale of vehicles to dealers, which generally occurs shortly after being produced. In contrast, our Automotive trade payables are based primarily on industry-standard production supplier payment terms of about 45 days. As a result, our cash flow deteriorates if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) decrease while trade payables continue to become due. Conversely, our cash flow improves if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) increase while new trade payables are generally not due for about 45 days. For example, the suspension of production at most of our assembly plants and lower industry volumes due to COVID-19 in early 2020 resulted in an initial deterioration of our cash flow, while the subsequent resumption of manufacturing operations and return to pre-COVID-19 production levels at most of our assembly plants resulted in a subsequent improvement of our cash flow. Even in normal economic conditions, however, these working capital balances generally are subject to seasonal changes that can impact cash flow. For example, we typically experience cash flow timing differences associated with inventories and payables due to our annual summer and December shutdown periods when production, and therefore inventories and wholesale volumes, are usually at their lowest levels, while payables continue to come due and be paid. The net impact of this typically results in cash outflows from changes in our working capital balances during these shutdown periods. \\n \\n Our finished product inventory at December 31, 2022 was higher year over year due to production and release scheduling, which resulted in higher sales inventory, in-transit inventory, and units awaiting upfit. \\n \\n In response to, or in anticipation of, supplier disruptions, we may stockpile certain components or raw materials to help prevent disruption in our production of vehicles. Such actions could have a short-term adverse impact on our cash and increase our inventory. Moreover, in order to secure critical materials for production of electric vehicles, we have entered into and plan to continue to enter into offtake agreements with raw material suppliers and make investments in certain raw material and battery suppliers, including contributing up to 6.6 billion in capital to BlueOval SK, LLC over a five-year period ending in 2026. Such investments, which are part of our plan to invest over 50 billion in electric vehicles through 2026, could have an additional adverse impact on our cash in the near-term. \\n \\n The terms of the offtake agreements we have entered into, and those we may enter into in the future, vary by transaction, though they generally obligate us to purchase a certain percentage or minimum amount of output produced by the counterparty over an agreed upon period of time. The purchase price mechanism included in the offtake agreement is typically based on the market price of the material at the time of delivery. The terms also may include conditions to our obligation to purchase the materials, such as quality or minimum output. Subject to satisfaction of those conditions, we will be obligated to purchase the materials at the cost determined by the purchase price mechanism. Based on the offtake agreements we have entered into thus far, the earliest date by which we could be obligated to purchase any output, subject to satisfaction of the applicable conditions, will be in 2024. \\n \\n Financial institutions participate in a supply chain finance SCF program that enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their Ford receivables (i.e., our payment obligations to the suppliers) to the financial institutions on a non-recourse basis in order to be paid earlier than our payment terms provide. Our suppliers voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms, the amounts we pay, or our liquidity. We have no economic interest in a supplier s decision to participate in the SCF program, and we have no direct financial relationship with the SCF financial institutions. Moreover, we do not provide any guarantees in connection with the SCF program. As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding amount of Ford receivables that suppliers elected to sell to the SCF financial institutions was 253 million. The amount settled through the SCF program during 2022 was 1.4 billion. \\n \\n 63 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Changes in Company cash excluding Ford Credit are summarized below (in billions): December 31, 2020 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2022 Company Excluding Ford Credit Company Adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit (a) (0.1) 5.3 7.8 Capital spending (5.7) (6.2) (6.5) Depreciation and tooling amortization 5.3 5.1 5.2 Net spending (0.4) (1.1) (1.3) Receivables 0.4 (0.2) (1.0) Inventory 0.3 (1.8) (2.5) Trade Payables 1.3 0.3 3.7 Changes in working capital 2.0 (1.7) 0.2 Ford Credit distributions 3.3 7.5 2.1 Interest on debt and cash taxes (1.8) (2.3) (1.7) All other and timing differences (1.7) (3.1) 1.9 Company adjusted free cash flow (a) 1.3 4.6 9.1 Global Redesign (including separations) (0.5) (1.9) (0.4) Changes in debt 8.4 (3.7) (0.4) Funded pension contributions (0.6) (0.8) (0.6) Shareholder distributions (0.6) (0.4) (2.5) All other (b) 0.5 7.9 (9.5) Change in cash 8.5 5.7 (4.3) \\n __________ \\n (a) See Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations section for reconciliation to GAAP. \\n (b) 2021 includes our investment in Rivian of 10.6 billion and cash premium paid of (1.6) billion associated with repurchasing and redeeming 7.6 billion of higher-coupon debt. 2022 includes a 7.4 billion loss on our Rivian investment. \\n Note: Numbers may not sum due to rounding. \\n \\n Our full year 2022 Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities was positive 6.9 billion, a decrease of 8.9 billion from a year ago (see page 79 for additional information). The year-over-year decrease was driven by a decrease in Ford Credit operating cash flow partially offset by favorable timing differences. Company adjusted free cash flow was 9.1 billion, 4.5 billion higher than a year ago, driven by higher Company adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit, timing benefits, improvement in working capital, and lower interest expense, offset partially by lower Ford Credit distributions. \\n \\n Capital spending was 6.5 billion in 2022, 0.3 billion higher than a year ago, and is expected to be in the range of 8 billion to 9 billion in 2023. \\n \\n The full year 2022 working capital impact was 0.2 billion positive, driven by higher payables. All other and timing differences were positive 1.9 billion. Timing differences include differences between accrual-based EBIT and the associated cash flows (e.g., pension and OPEB income or expense; compensation payments; marketing incentive and warranty payments to dealers). \\n \\n Shareholder distributions (including dividends and anti-dilutive share repurchases) were 2.5 billion in 2022. On February 2, 2023, we declared a regular dividend of 0.15 per share and a supplemental dividend of 0.65 per share. \\n \\n We previously announced our plan for the global redesign of our business, pursuant to which we are working to turn around automotive operations, compete like a challenger, and capitalize on our strengths by allocating more capital, more resources, and more talent to our strongest businesses and vehicle franchises. The cash effect related to our global redesign activities was 3.9 billion through December 31, 2022. \\n \\n 64 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Available Credit Lines . Total Company committed credit lines, excluding Ford Credit, at December 31, 2022 were 19.3 billion, consisting of 13.5 billion of our corporate credit facility, 2.0 billion of our supplemental revolving credit facility, 1.75 billion of our 364-day revolving credit facility, and 2.1 billion of local credit facilities. At December 31, 2022, the utilized portion of the corporate credit facility was 19 million, representing amounts utilized for letters of credit, and the full 1.75 billion of our 364-day revolving credit facility was utilized by Ford Credit, in its capacity as a subsidiary borrower under that facility. In addition, 1.7 billion of committed Company credit lines, excluding Ford Credit, was utilized under local credit facilities for our affiliates as of December 31, 2022. As of January 25, 2023, Ford Credit had repaid the full 1.75 billion outstanding under the 364-day revolving credit facility. \\n \\n Lenders under our corporate credit facility have 3.4 billion of commitments maturing on June 23, 2025 and 10.1 billion of commitments maturing on June 23, 2027. Lenders under our supplemental revolving credit facility have 0.1 billion of commitments maturing on September 29, 2024 and 1.9 billion of commitments maturing on June 23, 2025. Lenders under our 364-day revolving credit facility have 1.75 billion of commitments maturing on June 22, 2023. \\n \\n The corporate, supplemental, and 364-day credit agreements include certain sustainability-linked targets, pursuant to which the applicable margin and facility fees may be adjusted if Ford achieves, or fails to achieve, the specified targets related to global manufacturing facility greenhouse gas emissions, renewable electricity consumption, and Ford Europe CO 2 tailpipe emissions. Ford outperformed the 2021 targets for all three of the sustainability-linked metrics, which impacted pricing beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022. \\n \\n The corporate credit facility is unsecured and free of material adverse change conditions to borrowing, restrictive financial covenants (for example, interest or fixed-charge coverage ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and minimum net worth requirements), and credit rating triggers that could limit our ability to obtain funding or trigger early repayment. The corporate credit facility contains a liquidity covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum of 4 billion in aggregate of domestic cash, cash equivalents, and loaned and marketable securities and/or availability under the corporate credit facility, supplemental revolving credit facility, and 364-day revolving credit facility. The terms and conditions of the supplemental and 364-day revolving credit facilities are consistent with our corporate credit facility. Ford Credit has been designated as a subsidiary borrower under the corporate credit facility and the 364-day revolving credit facility. \\n \\n Each of the corporate credit facility, supplemental revolving credit facility, and 364-day revolving credit facility include a covenant that requires us to provide guarantees from certain of our subsidiaries in the event that our senior, unsecured, long-term debt does not maintain at least two investment grade ratings from Fitch, Moody s, and S P. The following subsidiaries have provided unsecured guarantees to the lenders under the credit facilities: Ford Component Sales, LLC; Ford European Holdings Inc.; Ford Global Technologies, LLC; Ford Holdings LLC (the parent company of Ford Credit); Ford International Capital LLC; Ford Mexico Holdings LLC; Ford Motor Service Company; Ford Next LLC; and Ford Trading Company, LLC. \\n \\n Debt. As shown in Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, at December 31, 2022, Company debt excluding Ford Credit was 19.9 billion. This balance is 400 million lower than at December 31, 2021, primarily reflecting the repayment in full of our 1.5 billion delayed draw term loan facility, repayment of the remaining 953 million under our Loan Arrangement and Reimbursement Agreement with the U.S. Department of Energy, a 1.1 billion redemption of higher coupon debt, and scheduled maturities, partially offset by the 750 million 903 million as of December 31, 2022) draw on our U.K. Export Finance term loan credit facility and the issuance of our 1.8 billion green bond and 600 million retail bond. \\n \\n Leverage. We manage Company debt (excluding Ford Credit) levels with a leverage framework that targets investment grade credit ratings through a normal business cycle. The leverage framework includes a ratio of total Company debt (excluding Ford Credit), underfunded pension liabilities, operating leases, and other adjustments, divided by Company adjusted EBIT (excluding Ford Credit EBT), and further adjusted to exclude depreciation and tooling amortization (excluding Ford Credit). \\n \\n Ford Credit s leverage is calculated as a separate business as described in the Liquidity - Ford Credit Segment section of Item 7. Ford Credit is self-funding and its debt, which is used to fund its operations, is separate from our Company debt excluding Ford Credit. \\n \\n 65 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Ford Credit Segment \\n \\n Ford Credit ended 2022 with 21 billion of liquidity. During the year, Ford Credit completed 16 billion of public term funding. \\n \\n Key elements of Ford Credit s funding strategy include: \\n \\n Maintain strong liquidity and funding diversity \\n Prudently access public markets \\n Continue growth of retail deposits in Europe \\n Flexibility to increase ABS mix as needed; preserving assets and committed capacity \\n Target financial statement leverage of 9:1 to 10:1 \\n Maintain self-liquidating balance sheet \\n \\n Ford Credit s liquidity profile continues to be diverse, robust, and focused on maintaining liquidity levels that meet its business and funding requirements. Ford Credit regularly stress tests its balance sheet and liquidity to ensure that it can continue to meet its financial obligations through economic cycles. \\n \\n Funding Sources. Ford Credit s funding sources include primarily unsecured debt and securitization transactions (including other structured financings). Ford Credit issues both short-term and long-term debt that is held by both institutional and retail investors, with long-term debt having an original maturity of more than 12 months. Ford Credit sponsors a number of securitization programs that can be structured to provide both short-term and long-term funding through institutional investors and other financial institutions in the United States and international capital markets. \\n \\n Ford Credit obtains unsecured funding from the sale of demand notes under its Ford Interest Advantage program and through the retail deposit programs at FCE Bank plc FCE and Ford Bank GmbH Ford Bank ). At December 31, 2022, the principal amount outstanding of Ford Interest Advantage notes, which may be redeemed at any time at the option of the holders thereof without restriction, and FCE and Ford Bank deposits was 14.3 billion. Ford Credit maintains multiple sources of readily available liquidity to fund the payment of its unsecured short-term debt obligations. \\n \\n The following table shows funding for Ford Credit s net receivables (in billions): December 31, 2020 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2022 Funding Structure Term unsecured debt 73.3 59.4 48.3 Term asset-backed securities 54.6 45.4 56.4 Ford Interest Advantage / Retail Deposits 9.8 12.9 14.3 Other (3.1) (0.2) 2.6 Equity 15.6 12.4 11.9 Adjustments for cash (18.5) (12.4) (11.2) Total Net Receivables 131.7 117.5 122.3 Securitized Funding as Percent of Total Debt 39.6 38.5 47.4 \\n \\n Net receivables of 122.3 billion at December 31, 2022 were funded primarily with term debt and term asset-backed securities.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Public Term Funding Plan. The following table shows Ford Credit s issuances for full year 2020, 2021, and 2022, and planned issuances for full year 2023, excluding short-term funding programs (in billions): \\n 2020 Actual 2021 Actual 2022 Actual 2023 Forecast Unsecured 14 5 6 10 - 13 Securitizations 13 9 10 10 - 13 Total public 27 14 16 20 - 26 \\n \\n In 2022, Ford Credit completed 16 billion of public term funding. For 2023, Ford Credit projects full year public term funding in the range of 20 billion to 26 billion. Through February 1, 2023, Ford Credit has completed 5 billion of public term issuances. \\n \\n Liquidity.

At December 31, 2022, Ford Credit s net liquidity available for use was 21 billion, 11 billion lower than year-end 2021. Ford Credit s net liquidity remains robust and aligns with lower near-term refinancing obligations. Ford Credit s sources of liquidity include cash, committed asset-backed facilities, and unsecured credit facilities. At December 31, 2022, Ford Credit s liquidity sources totaled 50.9 billion, down 1.3 billion from year-end 2021. Ford Credit continues to be well capitalized with a strong balance sheet. \\n \\n Material Cash Requirements. Ford Credit s material cash requirements include: (1) the purchase of retail financing and operating lease contracts from dealers and providing wholesale financing for dealers to finance new and used vehicles; and (2) debt repayments (for additional information on debt, see the Balance Sheet Liquidity Profile section below, the Material Cash Requirements section in Liquidity and Capital Resources - Company excluding Ford Credit above, and Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements). In addition, subject to approval by Ford Credit s Board of Directors, shareholder distributions may require the expenditure of a material amount of cash. Moreover, Ford Credit may be subject to additional material cash requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, e.g., legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions, and other matters. \\n \\n Ford Credit plans to utilize its liquidity (as described above) and its cash flows from business operations to fund its material cash requirements. \\n \\n 67 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Balance Sheet Liquidity Profile. Ford Credit defines its balance sheet liquidity profile as the cumulative maturities, including the impact of expected prepayments and allowance for credit losses, of its finance receivables, investment in operating leases, and cash, less the cumulative debt maturities over upcoming annual periods. Ford Credit s balance sheet is inherently liquid because of the short-term nature of its finance receivables, investment in operating leases, and cash. Ford Credit ensures its cumulative debt maturities have a longer tenor than its cumulative asset maturities. This positive maturity profile is intended to provide Ford Credit with additional liquidity after all of its assets have been funded and is in addition to liquidity available to protect for stress scenarios. \\n \\n The following table shows Ford Credit s cumulative maturities for assets and total debt for the periods presented and unsecured long-term debt maturities in the individual periods presented (in billions): \\n 2023 2024 2025 2026 and Beyond Balance Sheet Liquidity Profile Assets (a) 71 97 117 137 Total debt (b) 58 83 100 121 Memo: Unsecured long-term debt maturities 8 12 11 17 \\n __________ \\n (a) Includes gross finance receivables less the allowance for credit losses (including certain finance receivables that are reclassified in consolidation to Trade and other receivables ), investment in operating leases net of accumulated depreciation, cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding amounts related to insurance activities). Amounts shown include the impact of expected prepayments. \\n (b) Excludes unamortized debt (discount)/premium, unamortized issuance costs, and fair value adjustments. \\n \\n Maturities of investment in operating leases consist primarily of the portion of rental payments attributable to depreciation over the remaining life of the lease and the expected residual value at lease termination. Maturities of finance receivables and investment in operating leases in the table above include expected prepayments for Ford Credit s retail installment sale contracts and investment in operating leases. The table above also reflects adjustments to debt maturities to match the asset-backed debt maturities with the underlying asset maturities. \\n \\n All wholesale securitization transactions and wholesale receivables are shown maturing in the next 12 months, even if the maturities extend beyond 2023. The retail securitization transactions under certain committed asset-backed facilities are assumed to amortize immediately rather than amortizing after the expiration of the commitment period. As of December 31, 2022, Ford Credit had 137 billion of assets, 60 billion of which were unencumbered. \\n \\n Funding and Liquidity Risks. Ford Credit s funding plan is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control, including disruption in the capital markets that could impact both unsecured debt and asset-backed securities and the effects of regulatory changes on the financial markets. \\n \\n Despite Ford Credit s diverse sources of funding and liquidity, its ability to maintain liquidity may be affected by, among others, the following factors (not necessarily listed in order of importance or probability of occurrence): \\n \\n Prolonged disruption of the debt and securitization markets; \\n Global capital market volatility; \\n Credit ratings assigned to Ford and Ford Credit; \\n Market capacity for Ford- and Ford Credit-sponsored investments; \\n General demand for the type of securities Ford Credit offers; \\n Ford Credit s ability to continue funding through asset-backed financing structures; \\n Performance of the underlying assets within Ford Credit s asset-backed financing structures; \\n Inability to obtain hedging instruments; \\n Accounting and regulatory changes; and \\n Ford Credit s ability to maintain credit facilities and committed asset-backed facilities. \\n \\n Stress Tests. Ford Credit regularly conducts stress testing on its funding and liquidity sources to ensure it can continue to meet financial obligations and support the sale of Ford and Lincoln vehicles during firm-specific and market-wide stress events. Stress tests are intended to quantify the potential impact of various adverse scenarios on the balance sheet and liquidity. These scenarios include assumptions on access to unsecured and secured debt markets, runoff of short-term funding, and ability to renew expiring liquidity commitments and are measured over various time periods, including 30 days, 90 days, and longer term. Ford Credit s stress test does not assume any additional funding, liquidity, or capital support from Ford. Ford Credit routinely develops contingency funding plans as part of its liquidity stress testing. \\n 68 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Leverage. Ford Credit uses leverage, or the debt-to-equity ratio, to make various business decisions, including evaluating and establishing pricing for finance receivable and operating lease financing, and assessing its capital structure. \\n \\n The table below shows the calculation of Ford Credit s financial statement leverage (in billions): December 31, 2020 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2022 Leverage Calculation Debt 137.7 117.7 119.0 Equity (a) 15.6 12.4 11.9 Financial statement leverage (to 1) 8.8 9.5 10.0 \\n __________ \\n (a) Total shareholder s interest reported on Ford Credit s balance sheets. \\n \\n Ford Credit plans its leverage by considering market conditions and the risk characteristics of its business.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Total Company \\n \\n Pension Plan Contributions and Strategy. Our strategy is to reduce the risk of our funded defined benefit pension plans, including minimizing the volatility of the value of our pension assets relative to pension liabilities and the need for unplanned use of capital resources to fund the plans. The strategy reduces balance sheet, cash flow, and income exposures and, in turn, reduces our risk profile. Going forward, we expect to: \\n \\n Limit our pension contributions to offset ongoing service cost or meet regulatory requirements, if any; \\n Minimize the volatility of the value of our pension assets relative to pension obligations and ensure assets are sufficient to pay plan benefits; and \\n Evaluate strategic actions to reduce pension liabilities, such as plan design changes, curtailments, or settlements \\n 2021 2022 2022 H / (L) 2021 Pension Funded Status B) \\n U.S. Plans 1.0 0.1 (0.9) Non-U.S. Plans (1.3) (0.3) 1.0 Total Global Pension (0.3) (0.2) 0.1 Year-End Discount Rate (Weighted Average) \\n U.S. Plans 2.91 5.51 2.60 ppts Non-U.S. Plans 1.75 4.42 2.67 ppts Actual Asset Returns U.S. Plans 2.82 (21.20) (24.02) ppts Non-U.S. Plans 2.69 (25.40) (28.09) ppts Pension - Funded Plans Only B) \\n Funded Status 5.8 4.1 (1.7) Contributions for Funded Plans 0.8 0.6 (0.2) \\n \\n Worldwide, our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by 0.2 billion at December 31, 2022, an improvement of 0.1 billion from December 31, 2021, primarily reflecting the impact of higher discount rates mostly offset by negative asset performance. Of the 0.2 billion underfunded status at year-end 2022, our funded plans were 4.1 billion overfunded and our unfunded plans were 4.3 billion underfunded. These unfunded plans are pay as you go with benefits paid from Company cash and primarily include certain plans in Germany and U.S. defined benefit plans for senior management. \\n \\n The fixed income mix was 79 in both our U.S. plans and non-U.S. plans at year-end 2022. \\n \\n In 2022, we contributed 567 million to our global funded pension plans, a decrease of 206 million compared with 2021. During 2023, we expect to contribute between 500 million and 600 million of cash to our global funded pension plans. We also expect to make about 400 million of benefit payments to participants in unfunded plans. Based on current assumptions and regulations, we do not expect to have a legal requirement to fund our major U.S. plans in 2023. Our global funded plans remain fully funded in aggregate, demonstrating the effectiveness of our de-risking strategy and our commitment to a strong balance sheet. \\n \\n For a detailed discussion of our pension plans, refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates - Pensions and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2022 Form 10-K Report and Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. \\n 70 \\n\\nItem 7.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n CREDIT RATINGS \\n \\n Our short-term and long-term debt is rated by four credit rating agencies designated as nationally recognized statistical rating organizations NRSROs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission: DBRS, Fitch, Moody s, and S P. \\n \\n In several markets, locally recognized rating agencies also rate us. A credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the credit risk associated with a corporate entity or particular securities issued by that entity. Rating agencies ratings of us are based on information provided by us and other sources. Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria for evaluating company risk and, therefore, ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. \\n \\n There have been no rating actions taken by these NRSROs since the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. \\n \\n The following table summarizes certain of the credit ratings and outlook presently assigned by these four NRSROs: NRSRO RATINGS Ford Ford Credit NRSROs Issuer Default / Corporate / Issuer Rating Long-Term Senior Unsecured Outlook / Trend Long-Term Senior Unsecured Short-Term Unsecured Outlook / Trend Minimum Long-Term Investment Grade Rating DBRS BB (high) BB (high) Positive BB (high) R-4 Positive BBB (low) Fitch BB+ BB+ Positive BB+ B Positive BBB- Moody s N/A Ba2 Stable Ba2 NP Stable Baa3 S P BB+ BB+ Positive BB+ B Positive BBB- \\n \\n 72 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n OUTLOOK \\n \\n We provided 2023 Company guidance in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K dated February 2, 2023. The guidance is based on our expectations as of February 2, 2023. Our actual results could differ materially from our guidance due to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including those set forth in Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part I. 2023 Guidance Total Company Adjusted EBIT (a) 9 - 11 billion Adjusted Free Cash Flow (a) About 6 billion Capital spending 8 - 9 billion Ford Credit EBT About 1.3 billion \\n __________ \\n (a) When we provide guidance for Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted Free Cash Flow, we do not provide guidance for the most comparable GAAP measures because, as described in more detail below in Non-GAAP Measures That Supplement GAAP Measures, they include items that are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty. \\n\\nFor full-year 2023, we expect adjusted EBIT of 9 billion to 11 billion, which assumes a seasonally adjusted annual rate SAAR of about 15 million in the United States and about 13 million in Europe. We also expect adjusted free cash flow of about 6 billion, which assumes no distributions from Ford Credit. \\n \\n Our outlook for 2023 assumes the headwinds and tailwinds below. \\n \\n Headwinds: \\n An expected mild U.S. recession and a moderate recession in Europe \\n Higher incentives across the industry as supply and demand come back into balance \\n Ford Credit EBT of about 1.3 billion, down about 1.4 billion, reflecting unfavorable lease residuals and credit losses and the non-recurrence of derivative gains \\n Continuation of the strong dollar \\n About 2 billion lower past service pension income \\n Continued investments in growth, including in customer experience, connected services, and capital expenditures \\n \\n Tailwinds: \\n Improvement in the supply chain and industry volume \\n Launch of our all-new Super Duty \\n Lower cost of goods sold, including efficiencies in materials, commodities, logistics, and other parts of our industrial platform \\n \\n Additionally, we will be negotiating a new contract with the UAW in the United States. \\n \\n 73 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements \\n \\n Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations, forecasts, and assumptions by our management and involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: \\n \\n Ford and Ford Credit s financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by public health issues, including epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19; \\n Ford is highly dependent on its suppliers to deliver components in accordance with Ford s production schedule and specifications, and a shortage of or inability to acquire key components, such as semiconductors, or raw materials, such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, can disrupt Ford s production of vehicles; \\n To facilitate access to the raw materials necessary for the production of electric vehicles, Ford has entered into, and expects to continue to enter into, multi-year commitments to raw material suppliers that subject Ford to risks associated with lower future demand for such materials as well as costs that fluctuate and are difficult to accurately forecast; \\n Ford s long-term competitiveness depends on the successful execution of Ford+; \\n Ford s vehicles could be affected by defects that result in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, or increased warranty costs; \\n Ford may not realize the anticipated benefits of existing or pending strategic alliances, joint ventures, acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings, or new business strategies; \\n Operational systems, security systems, vehicles, and services could be affected by cyber incidents, ransomware attacks, and other disruptions and impact Ford and Ford Credit as well as their suppliers and dealers; \\n Ford s production, as well as Ford s suppliers production, and/or the ability to deliver products to consumers could be disrupted by labor issues, natural or man-made disasters, adverse effects of climate change, financial distress, production difficulties, capacity limitations, or other factors; \\n Ford s ability to maintain a competitive cost structure could be affected by labor or other constraints; \\n Ford s ability to attract and retain talented, diverse, and highly skilled employees is critical to its success and competitiveness; \\n Ford s new and existing products and digital, software, and physical services are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries and its reputation may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced; \\n Ford s results are dependent on sales of larger, more profitable vehicles, particularly in the United States; \\n With a global footprint, Ford s results could be adversely affected by economic or geopolitical developments, including protectionist trade policies such as tariffs, or other events; \\n Industry sales volume can be volatile and could decline if there is a financial crisis, recession, or significant geopolitical event; \\n Ford may face increased price competition or a reduction in demand for its products resulting from industry excess capacity, currency fluctuations, competitive actions, or other factors; \\n Inflationary pressure and fluctuations in commodity and energy prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and market value of Ford or Ford Credit s investments, including marketable securities, can have a significant effect on results; \\n Ford and Ford Credit s access to debt, securitization, or derivative markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts could be affected by credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, regulatory requirements, or other factors; \\n The impact of government incentives on Ford s business could be significant, and Ford s receipt of government incentives could be subject to reduction, termination, or clawback; \\n Ford Credit could experience higher-than-expected credit losses, lower-than-anticipated residual values, or higher-than-expected return volumes for leased vehicles; \\n Economic and demographic experience for pension and OPEB plans (e.g., discount rates or investment returns) could be worse than Ford has assumed; \\n Pension and other postretirement liabilities could adversely affect Ford s liquidity and financial condition; \\n Ford and Ford Credit could experience unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations, or adverse publicity arising out of alleged defects in products, services, perceived environmental impacts, or otherwise; \\n Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations; \\n Ford and Ford Credit could be affected by the continued development of more stringent privacy, data use, and data protection laws and regulations as well as consumers heightened expectations to safeguard their personal information; and \\n Ford Credit could be subject to new or increased credit regulations, consumer protection regulations, or other regulations. \\n \\n 74 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n We cannot be certain that any expectation, forecast, or assumption made in preparing forward-looking statements will prove accurate, or that any projection will be realized. It is to be expected that there may be differences between projected and actual results. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of their initial issuance, and we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. For additional discussion, see Item 1A. Risk Factors above. \\n 75 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT SUPPLEMENT GAAP MEASURES \\n \\n We use both generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for operational and financial decision making, and to assess Company and segment business performance. The non-GAAP measures listed below are intended to be considered by users as supplemental information to their equivalent GAAP measures, to aid investors in better understanding our financial results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful perspective on underlying operating results and trends, and a means to compare our period-over-period results. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in items or events being adjusted. \\n \\n Company Adjusted EBIT (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Income/(Loss) Attributable to Ford) Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) excludes interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), taxes, and pre-tax special items. This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it focuses on underlying operating results and trends, and improves comparability of our period-over-period results. Our management ordinarily excludes special items from its review of the results of the operating segments for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources. Our categories of pre-tax special items and the applicable significance guideline for each item (which may consist of a group of items related to a single event or action) are as follows: \\n \\n Pre-Tax Special Item Significance Guideline Pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses No minimum Gains and losses on investments in equity securities No minimum Personnel expenses, dealer-related costs, and facility-related charges stemming from our efforts to match production capacity and cost structure to market demand and changing model mix \\n Generally 100 million or more Other items that we do not necessarily consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities 500 million or more for individual field service actions; generally 100 million or more for other items \\n \\n When we provide guidance for adjusted EBIT, we do not provide guidance on a net income basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty, including gains and losses on pension and OPEB remeasurements and on investments in equity securities. \\n \\n Company Adjusted EBIT Margin (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Company Net Income/(Loss) Margin) Company Adjusted EBIT margin is Company adjusted EBIT divided by Company revenue. This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it allows users to evaluate our operating results aligned with industry reporting. \\n \\n Adjusted Earnings/(Loss) Per Share (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Earnings/(Loss) Per Share) Measure of Company s diluted net earnings/(loss) per share adjusted for impact of pre-tax special items (described above), tax special items, and restructuring impacts in noncontrolling interests. The measure provides investors with useful information to evaluate performance of our business excluding items not indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities. When we provide guidance for adjusted earnings/(loss) per share, we do not provide guidance on an earnings/(loss) per share basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses. \\n \\n Adjusted Effective Tax Rate (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Effective Tax Rate) Measure of Company s tax rate excluding pre-tax special items (described above) and tax special items. The measure provides an ongoing effective rate which investors find useful for historical comparisons and for forecasting. When we provide guidance for adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide guidance on an effective tax rate basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses. \\n 76 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Company Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Cash Provided By/(Used In) Operating Activities) Measure of Company s operating cash flow excluding Ford Credit s operating cash flows. The measure contains elements management considers operating activities, including Company excluding Ford Credit capital spending, Ford Credit distributions to its parent, and settlement of derivatives. The measure excludes cash outflows for funded pension contributions, global redesign (including separations), and other items that are considered operating cash flows under U.S. GAAP. This measure is useful to management and investors because it is consistent with management s assessment of the Company s operating cash flow performance. When we provide guidance for Company adjusted free cash flow, we do not provide guidance for net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities because the GAAP measure will include items that are difficult to quantify or predict with reasonable certainty, including cash flows related to the Company's exposures to foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices (separate from any related hedges), Ford Credit's operating cash flows, and cash flows related to special items, including separation payments, each of which individually or in the aggregate could have a significant impact to our net cash provided by/(used in) our operating activities. \\n \\n Adjusted ROIC Calculated as the sum of adjusted net operating profit/(loss) after cash tax from the last four quarters, divided by the average invested capital over the last four quarters. Adjusted Return on Invested Capital Adjusted ROIC provides management and investors with useful information to evaluate the Company s after-cash tax operating return on its invested capital for the period presented. Adjusted net operating profit/(loss) after cash tax measures operating results less special items, interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), and certain pension/OPEB costs. Average invested capital is the sum of average balance sheet equity, debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), and net pension/OPEB liability. \\n 77 \\n\\nItem 7.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \\n\\nWe consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. \\n \\n Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. \\n \\n Warranties and Field Service Actions \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required. We provide base warranties on the products we sell for specific periods of time and/or mileage, which vary depending upon the type of product and the geographic location of its sale. Separately, we also periodically perform field service actions related to safety recalls, emission recalls, and other product campaigns. Pursuant to these warranties and field service actions, we will repair, replace, or adjust parts on a vehicle that are defective in factory-supplied materials or workmanship. We accrue the estimated cost of both base warranty coverages and field service actions at the time of sale. In addition, from time to time, we issue extended warranties at our expense, the estimated cost of which is accrued at the time of issuance. \\n \\n Assumptions and Approach Used. We establish our estimate of base warranty obligations using a patterned estimation model. We use historical information regarding the nature, frequency, and average cost of claims for each vehicle line by model year. We reevaluate our estimate of base warranty obligations on a regular basis. Experience has shown that initial data for any given model year may be volatile; therefore, our process relies on long-term historical averages until sufficient data are available. With actual experience, we use the data to update the historical averages. We then compare the resulting accruals with present spending rates to assess whether the balances are adequate to meet expected future obligations. Based on this data, we update our estimates as necessary. \\n \\n Field service actions may occur in periods beyond the base warranty coverage period. We establish our estimates of field service action obligations using a patterned estimation model. We use historical information regarding the nature, frequency, severity, and average cost of claims for each model year. We assess our obligation for field service actions on a regular basis using actual claims experience and update our estimates as necessary. \\n \\n Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors used in establishing our estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 25 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for information regarding warranty and field service action costs. \\n \\n Pensions and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required. The estimation of our defined benefit pension and OPEB plan obligations and expenses requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events, such as demographic experience and health care cost increases. Plan obligations and expenses are based on existing retirement plan provisions. No assumption is made regarding any potential future changes to benefit provisions beyond those to which we are presently committed (e.g., in existing labor contracts). \\n 84 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Assumptions and Approach Used. The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: \\n \\n Discount rates. Our discount rate assumptions are based primarily on the results of cash flow matching analyses, which match the future cash outflows for each major plan to a yield curve based on high-quality bonds specific to the country of the plan. Benefit payments are discounted at the rates on the curve to determine the year-end obligations. \\n \\n Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Our expected long-term rate of return considers inputs from a range of advisors for capital market returns, inflation, bond yields, and other variables, adjusted for specific aspects of our investment strategy by plan. Historical returns also are considered when appropriate. The assumption is based on consideration of all inputs, with a focus on long-term trends to avoid short-term market influences. \\n \\n Salary growth. Our salary growth assumption reflects our actual experience, long-term outlook, and assumed inflation. \\n \\n Inflation. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators, including real gross domestic product growth and central bank inflation targets. \\n \\n Expected contributions. Our expected amount and timing of contributions are based on an assessment of minimum requirements, cash availability, and other considerations (e.g., funded status, avoidance of regulatory premiums and levies, and tax efficiency). \\n \\n Retirement rates. Retirement rates are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience. \\n \\n Mortality rates. Mortality rates are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience. \\n \\n Health care cost trends . Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook, and an assessment of likely long-term trends. \\n \\n Assumptions are set at each year-end and are generally not changed during the year unless there is a major plan event, such as a curtailment or settlement that would trigger a plan remeasurement. \\n \\n See Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding pension and OPEB costs and assumptions. \\n \\n Pension Plans \\n \\n Effect of Actual Results . The year-end 2022 weighted average discount rate was 5.51 for U.S. plans and 4.42 for non-U.S. plans, reflecting increases of 260 and 267 basis points, respectively, compared with year-end 2021. In 2022, the U.S. actual return on assets was negative 21.20 , which was lower than the expected long-term rate of return of 5.75 . Non-U.S. actual return on assets was negative 25.40 , which was lower than the expected long-term rate of return of 3.29 . The lower returns are explained by losses on fixed income and growth assets, both of which were consistent with broader market performance. In total, higher rates and pension asset losses, in addition to demographic and other updates, resulted in a net remeasurement loss of 1.3 billion, which has been recognized within net periodic benefit cost and reported as a special item. \\n \\n For 2023, the expected long-term rate of return on assets is 6.25 for U.S. plans, up 50 basis points from 2022, and 4.13 for non-U.S. plans, up 84 basis points compared with a year ago, reflecting higher nominal risk-free rates and a higher consensus on capital market return expectations from advisors. \\n \\n De-risking Strategy . We employ a broad de-risking strategy for our global funded plans that increases the matching characteristics of our assets relative to our obligation as funded status improves. Changes in interest rates, which directly influence changes in discount rates, in addition to other factors have a significant impact on the value of our pension obligation and fixed income asset portfolio. Our de-risking strategy has increased the allocation to fixed income investments and reduced our funded status sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates should result in offsetting effects in the value of our pension obligation and the value of the fixed income asset portfolio. \\n 85 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Sensitivity Analysis. The December 31, 2022 pension funded status and 2023 expense are affected by year-end 2022 assumptions. Sensitivities to these assumptions may be asymmetric and are specific to the time periods noted. The effects of changes in the factors that generally have the largest impact on year-end funded status and pension expense are discussed below. \\n \\n Discount rates and interest rates have the largest impact on our obligations and fixed income assets. The table below estimates the effect on our funded status of an increase/decrease in discount rates and interest rates (in millions): Basis Point Change Increase/(Decrease) in December 31, 2022 Funded Status Factor U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans Discount rate - obligation +/- 100 bps 2,700/ (3,200) 2,500/ (3,100) Interest rate - fixed income assets +/- 100 (2,600)/3,100 (1,700)/2,000 Net impact on funded status 100/ (100) 800/ (1,100) \\n \\n The fixed income asset sensitivity shown excludes other fixed income return components (e.g., changes in credit spreads, bond coupon and active management excess returns), and growth asset returns. Other factors that affect net funded status (e.g., contributions) are not reflected. \\n \\n Interest rates and the expected long-term rate of return on assets have the largest effect on pension expense. These assumptions are generally set at each year-end for expense recorded throughout the following year. The table below estimates the effect on pension expense of a higher/lower assumption for these factors (in millions): Basis Point Change Increase/(Decrease) in 2023 Pension Expense Factor U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans Interest rate - service cost and interest cost +/- 25 bps 25/ (25) 10/ (10) Expected long-term rate of return on assets +/- 25 (80)/80 (50)/50 \\n \\n The effect of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities. The sensitivity of pension expense to a change in discount rate assumptions may not be linear. \\n \\n Other Postretirement Employee Benefits \\n \\n Effect of Actual Results . The weighted average discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation for worldwide OPEB plans at December 31, 2022 was 5.48 , compared with 2.97 at December 31, 2021, resulting in a worldwide net remeasurement gain of 1.3 billion, which has been recognized within net periodic benefit cost and reported as a special item. \\n \\n Sensitivity Analysis. Discount rates and interest rates have the largest effect on our OPEB obligation and expense. The table below estimates the effect on 2023 OPEB expense of higher/lower assumptions for these factors (in millions): Worldwide OPEB Basis Point Change (Increase)/Decrease 2022 YE Obligation Increase/(Decrease) 2023 Expense Factor Discount rate - obligation +/- 100 bps 415/ (495) N/A Interest rate - service cost and interest cost +/- 25 N/A 5/ (5) \\n \\n Income Taxes \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required. We must make estimates and apply judgment in determining the provision for income taxes for financial reporting purposes. We make these estimates and judgments primarily in the following areas: (i) the calculation of tax credits, (ii) the calculation of differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax reporting and financial statement purposes, as well as (iii) the calculation of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Changes in these estimates and judgments may result in a material increase or decrease to our tax provision, which would be recorded in the period in which the change occurs. \\n 86 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Assumptions and Approach Used. We are subject to the income tax laws and regulations of the many jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws and regulations are complex and involve uncertainties in the application to our facts and circumstances that may be open to interpretation. We recognize benefits for these uncertain tax positions based upon a process that requires judgment regarding the technical application of the laws, regulations, and various related judicial opinions. If, in our judgment, it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50 that the uncertain tax position will be settled favorably for us, we estimate an amount that ultimately will be realized. This process is inherently subjective since it requires our assessment of the probability of future outcomes. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis, including consideration of changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial opinions, as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. Changes to our estimate of the amount to be realized are recorded in our provision for income taxes during the period in which the change occurred. \\n \\n We must also assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income and reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized. \\n \\n This assessment, which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis, takes into account various types of evidence, including the following: \\n \\n Nature, frequency, and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses. A pattern of objectively measured recent financial reporting losses is heavily weighted as a source of negative evidence. We generally consider cumulative pre-tax losses in the three-year period ending with the current quarter to be significant negative evidence regarding future profitability. We also consider the strength and trend of earnings, as well as other relevant factors. In certain circumstances, historical information may not be as relevant due to changes in our business operations; \\n \\n Sources of future taxable income. Future reversals of existing temporary differences are heavily weighted sources of objectively verifiable positive evidence. Projections of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences are a source of positive evidence only when the projections are combined with a history of recent profits and can be reasonably estimated. Otherwise, these projections are considered inherently subjective and generally will not be sufficient to overcome negative evidence that includes relevant cumulative losses in recent years, particularly if the projected future taxable income is dependent on an anticipated turnaround to profitability that has not yet been achieved. In such cases, we generally give these projections of future taxable income no weight for the purposes of our valuation allowance assessment; and \\n \\n Tax planning strategies. If necessary and available, tax planning strategies could be implemented to accelerate taxable amounts to utilize expiring carryforwards. These strategies would be a source of additional positive evidence and, depending on their nature, could be heavily weighted. \\n \\n In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider the trade-offs between cash preservation and cash outlays to preserve tax credits. During 2022, we reversed 405 million of U.S. valuation allowances primarily as a result of planning actions. We presently believe that global valuation allowances of 822 million are required and that we ultimately will recover the remaining 14 billion of deferred tax assets. However, the ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets is subject to a number of variables, including our future profitability within relevant tax jurisdictions, and future tax planning and the related effects on our cash and liquidity position. Accordingly, our valuation allowances may increase or decrease in future periods. \\n \\n For additional information regarding income taxes, see Note 7 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. \\n 87 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Impairment of Long-Lived Assets \\n \\n Asset groups are tested at the level of the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Our asset groups presently are the regional Automotive business units (i.e., North America, South America, Europe, China (including Taiwan), and the International Markets Group), Ford Credit, and the separate legal entities within the Mobility segment. Asset groupings for impairment analysis are reevaluated when events occur, such as changes in organizational structure and management reporting. As a result of the new organizational and segment structure that will be implemented in 2023, our asset groups are expected to be Ford Blue North America, Ford Blue Europe, Ford Blue Rest of World, Ford Model e, Ford Pro, Ford Credit, and Ford Next (formerly Mobility). \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required - Held-and-Used Long-Lived Assets. We test our long-lived asset groups when changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable. Events that trigger a test for recoverability include material adverse changes in projected revenues or expenses, present cash flow losses combined with a history of cash flow losses and a forecast that demonstrates significant continuing losses, significant negative industry or economic trends (including a substantial shift in consumer preference), a current expectation that a long-lived asset group will be disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life, a significant adverse change in the manner in which an asset group is used or in its physical condition, or when there is a change in the asset grouping. In addition, investing in new, emerging products (e.g., EVs) or services (e.g., connectivity) may require substantial upfront investment, which may result in initial forecasted negative cash flows in the near term. In these instances, near term negative cash flows on their own may not be indicative of a triggering event for evaluation of impairment. In such circumstances we also conduct a qualitative evaluation of the business growth trajectory, which includes updating our assessment of when positive cash flows are expected to be generated, confirming whether established milestones are being achieved, and assessing our ability and intent to continue to access required funding to execute the plan. If this evaluation indicates a triggering event has occurred, a test for recoverability is performed. \\n \\n When a triggering event occurs, a test for recoverability is performed, comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group. If the undiscounted forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, the asset group s fair value is measured relying primarily on a discounted cash flow method. To the extent available, we will also consider third-party valuations of our long-lived assets that were prepared for other business purposes. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value. When an impairment loss is recognized for assets to be held and used, the adjusted carrying amounts of those assets are depreciated over their remaining useful life. \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required - Held-for-Sale Operations. We perform an impairment test on a disposal group to be discontinued, held for sale, or otherwise disposed of when we have committed to an action and the action is expected to be completed within one year. We estimate fair value to approximate the expected proceeds to be received less cost to sell and compare it to the carrying value of the disposal group. An impairment charge is recognized when the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. \\n \\n Assumptions and Approach Used - Held-and-Used Long-Lived Assets. Fair value of an asset group is determined from the perspective of a market-participant considering, among other things, appropriate discount rates, valuation techniques, the most advantageous market, and assumptions about the highest and best use of the asset group. \\n \\n We measure the fair value of an asset group based on market prices (i.e., the amount for which the asset could be sold to a third party) when available. When market prices are not available, we generally estimate the fair value of the asset group using the income approach and/or the market approach. The income approach uses cash flow projections. Inherent in our development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results, business plan forecasts, expected growth rates, and cost of capital, similar to those a market participant would use to assess fair value. We also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions and other data. Many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management, and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods. \\n \\n Changes in assumptions or estimates can materially affect the fair value measurement of an asset group and, therefore, can affect the test results. The following are key assumptions we use in making cash flow projections: \\n \\n Business projections. We make assumptions about the demand for our products in the marketplace. These \\n assumptions drive our planning assumptions for volume, mix, and pricing. We also make assumptions about our cost levels (e.g., capacity utilization, cost performance). These projections are derived using our internal business plan forecasts that are updated at least annually and reviewed by our Board of Directors. \\n 88 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Long-term growth rate. A growth rate is used to calculate the terminal value of the business and is added to the present value of the debt-free interim cash flows. The growth rate is the expected rate at which an asset group s business unit s earnings stream is projected to grow beyond the planning period. \\n \\n Discount rate. When measuring possible impairment, future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted-average cost of capital that we anticipate a potential market participant would use. Weighted-average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall risk-adjusted pre-tax rate of return expected by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise. \\n \\n Economic projections. Assumptions regarding general economic conditions are included in and affect our assumptions regarding industry sales and pricing estimates for our vehicles. These macroeconomic assumptions include, but are not limited to, industry sales volumes, inflation, interest rates, prices of raw materials (e.g., commodities), and foreign currency exchange rates. \\n \\n The market approach is another method for measuring the fair value of a reporting unit or asset group. This approach relies on the market value (i.e., market capitalization) of companies that are engaged in the same or similar line of business as the reporting unit or asset group being evaluated. In addition, to the extent available we also consider third-party valuations that were prepared for other business purposes. \\n \\n During 2022, we continued to progress our global redesign. Against this backdrop, we determined that there were triggering events related to our South America and International Markets Group IMG business units. We also assessed our expected new 2023 asset groups, which consist of Ford Blue North America, Ford Blue Europe, Ford Blue Rest of World, Ford Model e, Ford Pro, Ford Credit and Ford Next and assessed these groups for triggering events and potential impairment. We determined that the carrying values of the long-lived assets were recoverable at December 31, 2022 under our existing assets groups as well as under our anticipated 2023 asset groups. If in future quarters our economic or business projections were to change as a result of our plans or changes in the economic or business environment, there was a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used, or there was a current expectation that a long-lived asset group will be disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life, we would undertake additional testing, as appropriate, which could result in an impairment of long-lived assets. \\n \\n Assumptions and Approach Used - Held-for-Sale Operations . In the third quarter of 2022, we entered into an agreement to sell our Sanand, India vehicle assembly and powertrain plants to Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Limited Tata ). The sale transaction included the land, buildings, and other fixed assets (excluding the powertrain machinery and equipment) for the plants. Accordingly, we have reported 88 million of fixed assets for this operation as held for sale for the period ended December 31, 2022. We recognized pre-tax impairment charges in Cost of sales of 32 million in the third quarter of 2022 to adjust the carrying value of the held-for-sale assets to fair value less costs to sell. We determined fair value using the market approach, estimated based on the negotiated value of the assets. On January 10, 2023, we completed the sale of the plants to Tata. See Note 22 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding held-for-sale operations. \\n\\nAllowance for Credit Losses \\n \\n The allowance for credit losses represents Ford Credit s estimate of the expected lifetime credit losses inherent in finance receivables as of the balance sheet date. The adequacy of Ford Credit s allowance for credit losses is assessed quarterly, and the assumptions and models used in establishing the allowance are evaluated regularly. Because credit losses can vary substantially over time, estimating credit losses requires a number of assumptions about matters that are uncertain. Changes in assumptions affect Ford Credit interest, operating, and other expenses on our consolidated income statements and the allowance for credit losses contained within Ford Credit finance receivables, net on our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding allowance for credit losses. \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required. Ford Credit estimates the allowance for credit losses for receivables that share similar risk characteristics based on a collective assessment using a combination of measurement models and management judgment. The models consider factors such as historical trends in credit losses, recent portfolio performance, and forward-looking macroeconomic conditions. The models vary by portfolio and receivable type including consumer finance receivables, wholesale loans, and dealer loans. If Ford Credit does not believe the models reflect lifetime expected credit losses for the portfolio, an adjustment is made to reflect management judgment regarding qualitative factors including economic uncertainty, observable changes in portfolio performance, and other relevant factors. \\n\\n89 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Assumptions Used. Ford Credit s allowance for credit losses is based on its assumptions regarding: \\n \\n Probability of default . The expected probability of payment and time to default, which include assumptions about macroeconomic factors and recent performance; and \\n Loss given default. The percentage of the expected balance due at default that is not recoverable. The loss given default takes into account expected collateral value and future recoveries. \\n \\n Macroeconomic factors used in Ford Credit s models are country specific and include variables such as unemployment rates, personal bankruptcy filings, housing prices, and gross domestic product. \\n \\n Sensitivity Analysis. Changes in the probability of default and loss given default assumptions would affect the allowance for credit losses. The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions for Ford Credit s U.S. Ford and Lincoln retail financing is as follows (in millions): Assumption Basis Point Change \\n Increase/(Decrease) Probability of default (lifetime) +/- 100 bps 210/ (210) Loss given default +/- 100 10/(10) \\n \\n Accumulated Depreciation on Vehicles Subject to Operating Leases \\n \\n Accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases reduces the value of the leased vehicles in Ford Credit s operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their expected residual value at the end of the lease term. \\n \\n Ford Credit monitors residual values each month, and it reviews the adequacy of accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis. If Ford Credit believes that the expected residual values for its vehicles have changed, it revises depreciation to ensure that net investment in operating leases (equal to the acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation) will be adjusted to reflect Ford Credit s revised estimate of the expected residual value at the end of the lease term. Adjustments to depreciation expense result in a change in the depreciation rates of the vehicles subject to operating leases and are recorded prospectively on a straight-line basis. \\n \\n Generally, lease customers have the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer. \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required. Each operating lease in Ford Credit s portfolio represents a vehicle it owns that has been leased to a customer. At the time Ford Credit purchases a lease, it establishes an expected residual value for the vehicle. Ford Credit estimates the expected residual value by evaluating recent auction values, return volumes for its leased vehicles, industrywide used vehicle prices, marketing incentive plans, and vehicle quality data. \\n \\n Assumptions Used. Ford Credit s accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases is based on assumptions regarding: \\n \\n Auction value. Ford Credit s projection of the market value of the vehicles when sold at the end of the lease; and \\n Return volume. Ford Credit s projection of the number of vehicles that will be returned at lease-end. \\n \\n See Note 12 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases. \\n\\n90 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Sensitivity Analysis. For returned vehicles, Ford Credit faces a risk that the amount it obtains from the vehicle sold at auction will be less than its estimate of the expected residual value for the vehicle. The impact of the change in assumptions on future auction values and return volumes would increase or decrease accumulated supplemental depreciation and depreciation expense over the remaining terms of the operating leases; however, the impact may be tempered or exacerbated based on future auction values in relation to the purchase price specified in the lease contract. A change in the assumption for an auction value will impact Ford Credit s estimate of accumulated supplemental depreciation if the future auction value is lower than the purchase price specified in the lease contract. The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions for Ford Credit s U.S. Ford and Lincoln operating lease portfolio is as follows (in millions): Assumption Basis Point \\n Change \\n Increase/(Decrease) Future auction values +/- 100 bps (10)/ 10 Return volumes +/- 100 5/(5) \\n \\n Adjustments to the amount of accumulated supplemental depreciation on operating leases are reflected on our balance sheets as Net investment in operating leases and on our income statements in Ford Credit interest, operating, and other expenses. \\n 91 \\n\\nItem 7.

      " COVID-19 and Supplier Disruptions. The impact of COVID-19, including changes in consumer behavior, pandemic fears and market downturns, and restrictions on business and individual activities, has created significant volatility in the global economy. Outbreaks in certain regions continue to cause intermittent COVID-19-related disruptions in our supply chain and local manufacturing operations. We also continue to face supplier disruptions due to labor shortages and other production issues, in addition to the continuing semiconductor shortage. Our inconsistent production schedule has been disruptive to our suppliers operations, which, in turn, has led to higher costs and production shortfalls. Further, actions taken by Russia in Ukraine have impacted and could further impact our suppliers, particularly our lower tier suppliers, as well as our operations in Europe. For additional information on the impact of supplier disruptions, see the Outlook section on page 73 . \n",

      " Currency Exchange Rate Volatility. After aggressively easing monetary policy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve, and other central banks around the world, in 2022 began to withdraw monetary stimulus by raising interest rates. Periods of monetary policy tightening are often associated with heightened financial market and currency volatility, especially for those markets that are outliers in terms of their economic or monetary policy backdrop. This is notable for many emerging markets, which may also face increased exposure to commodity prices and political instability, contributing to unpredictable movements in the value of their exchange rates. In addition to direct impacts on the financial flows of global automotive companies, currency movements can also impact pricing of vehicles exported to overseas markets. In most markets, exchange rates are market-determined, and all are impacted by many different macroeconomic and policy factors, and thus likely to remain volatile. However, in some markets, exchange rates are heavily influenced or controlled by governments. \n",

      " Pricing Pressure. Over the last year, prices of both new and used vehicles have increased substantially due to strong demand, supply shortages, and inflationary costs. We have already observed some moderation in the rate of price increases as auto production slowly recovers from the semiconductor shortage, but it is unclear whether prices will decline fully to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. Over the long term, intense competition and excess capacity are likely to put downward pressure on inflation-adjusted prices for similarly-contented vehicles and contribute to a challenging pricing environment for the automotive industry in most major markets. \n",
      " \n",
      " Commodity and Energy Prices. Prices for commodities remain volatile. In some cases, spot prices for various commodities have recently diverged somewhat, as anticipated weakening in global industrial activity mitigates price increases for base metals such as steel and aluminum, while precious metals (e.g., palladium), and raw materials that are used in batteries for electric vehicles (e.g., lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, among other materials, for batteries) remain high. The net impact on us and our suppliers has been higher material costs overall. To help ensure supply of raw materials for critical components (e.g., batteries), we, like others in the industry, have entered into multi-year sourcing agreements and may enter into additional agreements. Similar dynamics are impacting energy markets, with Europe particularly exposed to the risk of both higher prices and constraints on supply of natural gas due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Such shortages may impact facilities operated by us or our suppliers, which could have an impact on us in Europe and other regions. In the long term, the outcome of de-carbonization and electrification of the vehicle fleet may depress oil demand, but the global energy transition will also contribute to ongoing volatility of oil and other energy prices. For additional information on commodity costs, see the Outlook section on page 73 . \n",

      " Vehicle Profitability. Our financial results depend on the profitability of the vehicles we sell, which may vary significantly by vehicle line. In general, larger vehicles tend to command higher prices and be more profitable than smaller vehicles, both across and within vehicle segments. For example, in North America, our larger, more profitable vehicles had an average contribution margin that was 120 of our total average contribution margin across all vehicles, whereas our smaller vehicles had significantly lower contribution margins. In addition, government regulations aimed at reducing emissions and increasing fuel efficiency (e.g., ZEV mandates and low emission zones), and other factors that accelerate the transition to electrified vehicles, may increase the cost of vehicles by more than the perceived benefit to consumers and dampen margins. \n",

      " Trade Policy. To the extent governments in various regions implement or intensify barriers to imports, such as erecting tariff or non-tariff barriers or manipulating their currency, and provide advantages to local exporters selling into the global marketplace, there can be a significant negative impact on manufacturers based in other markets. While we believe the long-term trend will support the growth of free trade, we will continue to monitor and address developing issues. \n",
      " \n",
      " Inflation and Interest Rates. We continue to see near-term impacts on our business due to inflation, including ongoing global price pressures in the wake of Russia s invasion of Ukraine, driving up energy prices, freight premiums, and other operating costs above normal rates. Although headline inflation in the United States and Europe appears to have peaked, as gasoline and natural gas prices recede from the latest spike, core inflation (excluding food and energy prices) remains elevated and is a source of continued cost pressure on businesses and households. Interest rates have increased significantly as central banks in developed countries attempt to subdue inflation while government deficits and debt remain at high levels in many global markets. Accordingly, the eventual implications of higher government deficits and debt, tighter monetary policy, and potentially higher long-term interest rates may drive a higher cost of capital for the business. At Ford Credit, rising interest rates may impact its ability to source funding and offer financing at competitive rates, which could reduce its financing margin. \n",

      " Revenue \n",
      " \n",
      " Our Automotive segment revenue is generated primarily by sales of vehicles, parts, and accessories. Revenue is recorded when control is transferred to our customers (generally, our dealers and distributors). For the majority of sales, this occurs when products are shipped from our manufacturing facilities. However, we defer a portion of the consideration received when there is a separate future or stand-ready performance obligation, such as extended service contracts or ongoing vehicle connectivity. Revenue related to extended service contracts is recognized over the term of the agreement in proportion to the costs we expect to incur in satisfying the contract obligations; revenue related to other future or stand-ready performance obligations is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the period in which services are expected to be performed. Vehicles sold to daily rental car companies with an obligation to repurchase for a guaranteed amount, exercisable at the option of the customer, are accounted for as operating leases, with lease revenue recognized over the term of the lease. Proceeds from the sale of vehicles at auction are recognized in revenue upon transfer of control of the vehicle to the buyer. \n",
      " \n",
      " Most of the vehicles sold by us to our dealers and distributors are financed at wholesale by Ford Credit. Upon Ford Credit originating the wholesale receivable related to a dealer s purchase of a vehicle, Ford Credit pays cash to the relevant Automotive legal entity in payment of the dealer s obligation for the purchase price of the vehicle. The dealer then pays the wholesale finance receivable to Ford Credit when it sells the vehicle to a retail customer. \n",
      " \n",
      " Our Ford Credit segment revenue is generated primarily from interest on finance receivables and revenue from operating leases. Revenue from interest on finance receivables is recognized over the term of the receivable using the interest method and includes the amortization of certain deferred origination costs. Revenue from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. \n",
      " \n",
      " Transactions between our Automotive and Ford Credit segments occur in the ordinary course of business. For example, we offer special retail financing and lease incentives to dealers customers who choose to finance or lease our vehicles from Ford Credit. The cost for these incentives is included in our estimate of variable consideration at the date the related vehicle sales to our dealers are recorded. In order to compensate Ford Credit for the lower interest or lease payments offered to the retail customer, we pay the discounted value of the incentive directly to Ford Credit when it originates the retail finance or lease contract with the dealer s customer. Ford Credit recognizes the incentive amount over the life of retail finance contracts as an element of financing revenue and over the life of lease contracts as a reduction to depreciation. See Note 1 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of transactions between our Automotive and Ford Credit segments. \n",

      " Costs and Expenses \n",
      " \n",
      " Our income statement classifies our Company excluding Ford Credit total costs and expenses into two categories: (i) cost of sales, and (ii) selling, administrative, and other expenses. We include within cost of sales those costs related to the development, production, and distribution of our vehicles, parts, accessories, and services. Specifically, we include in cost of sales each of the following: material costs (including commodity costs); freight costs; warranty, including product recall costs; labor and other costs related to the development and production of our vehicles and connectivity, parts, accessories, and services; depreciation and amortization; and other associated costs. We include within selling, administrative, and other expenses labor and other costs not directly related to the development and production of our vehicles, parts, accessories, and services, including such expenses as advertising and sales promotion costs. \n",
      " \n",
      " Certain of our costs, such as material costs, generally vary directly with changes in volume and mix of production. In our industry, production volume often varies significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. Quarterly production volumes experience seasonal shifts throughout the year (including peak retail sales seasons and the impact on production of model changeover and new product launches). Annual production volumes are heavily impacted by external economic factors, including the pace of economic growth and factors such as the availability of consumer credit and cost of fuel. \n",
      " \n",
      " As a result, we analyze the profit impact of certain cost changes holding constant present-year volume and mix and currency exchange, in order to evaluate our cost trends absent the impact of varying production and currency exchange levels. We analyze these cost changes in the following categories: \n",
      " \n",
      " Contribution Costs these costs typically vary with production volume. These costs include material (including commodity), warranty, and freight and duty costs. \n",
      " \n",
      " Structural Costs these costs typically do not have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume. These costs include manufacturing; vehicle and software engineering; spending-related; advertising and sales promotion; administrative, information technology, and selling; and pension and OPEB costs. \n",
      " \n",
      " While contribution costs generally vary directly in proportion to production volume, elements within our structural costs category are impacted to differing degrees by changes in production volume. We also have varying degrees of discretion when it comes to controlling the different elements within our structural costs. For example, depreciation and amortization expense largely is associated with prior capital spending decisions. On the other hand, while labor costs do not vary directly with production volume, manufacturing labor costs may be impacted by changes in volume, for example when we increase overtime, add a production shift, or add personnel to support volume increases. Other structural costs, such as advertising or engineering costs, do not necessarily have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume. Our structural costs generally are within our discretion, although to varying degrees, and can be adjusted over time in response to external factors. \n",
      " \n",
      " We consider certain structural costs to be a direct investment in future growth and revenue. For example, structural costs are necessary to grow our business and improve profitability, invest in new products and technologies, respond to increasing industry sales volume, and grow our market share. \n",
      " \n",
      " Cost of sales and Selling, administrative, and other expenses for full year 2022 were 145.3 billion. Our Automotive segment s material and commodity costs make up the largest portion of these costs and expenses, followed by structural costs. Although material costs are our largest absolute cost, our margins can be affected significantly by changes in any category of costs. \n",

Additionally, because of the significant additional capital and time required to achieve commercialization of L4, as well as other macroeconomic factors, Argo AI has been unable to attract new investors. After performing external outreach in the third quarter to assess market interest in acquiring either Argo AI or its technology components and conducting internal reviews to evaluate opportunities to leverage Argo AI s technology, Ford determined that Argo AI no longer has value as a going concern. As a result, we reassessed the carrying value of our investment in Argo AI starting from September 30, 2022, and in October, Ford and VW initiated the process of exiting the joint development of L4 technology through Argo AI. Accordingly, in the second half of 2022, we recorded as a special item a 2.7 billion pre-tax impairment on our Argo AI investment, and on October 26, 2022, we announced that Argo AI plans to wind down operations, which is in progress. \n",

      " \n",
      " Volume and Mix: \n",
      " Volume primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by changes in average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses at prior period financing margin yield (defined below in financing margin) at prior period exchange rates. Volume changes are primarily driven by the volume of new and used vehicles sold and leased, the extent to which Ford Credit purchases retail financing and operating lease contracts, the extent to which Ford Credit provides wholesale financing, the sales price of the vehicles financed, the level of dealer inventories, Ford-sponsored special financing programs available exclusively through Ford Credit, and the availability of cost-effective funding \n",

      " Financing margin variance is the period-to-period change in financing margin yield multiplied by the present period average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses at prior period exchange rates. This calculation is performed at the product and country level and then aggregated. Financing margin yield equals revenue, less interest expense and scheduled depreciation for the period, divided by average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses for the same period \n",
      " Financing margin changes are driven by changes in revenue and interest expense. Changes in revenue are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, cost assumptions in pricing, mix of business, and competitive environment. Changes in interest expense are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, borrowing spreads, and asset-liability management \n",

      " Net charge-off changes are primarily driven by the number of repossessions, severity per repossession, and recoveries. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are primarily driven by changes in historical trends in credit losses and recoveries, changes in the composition and size of Ford Credit s present portfolio, changes in trends in historical used vehicle values, and changes in forward looking macroeconomic conditions.

      " Lease residual measures changes to residual performance at prior period exchange rates. For analysis purposes, management splits residual performance primarily into residual gains and losses, and the change in accumulated supplemental depreciation \n",
      " Residual gain and loss changes are primarily driven by the number of vehicles returned to Ford Credit and sold, and the difference between the auction value and the depreciated value (which includes both base and accumulated supplemental depreciation) of the vehicles sold. Changes in accumulated supplemental depreciation are primarily driven by changes in Ford Credit s estimate of the expected auction value at the end of the lease term, and changes in Ford Credit s estimate of the number of vehicles that will be returned to it and sold. Depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases includes early termination losses on operating leases due to customer default events.

      " With respect to Changes in working capital, in general we carry relatively low Automotive segment trade receivables compared with our trade payables because the majority of our Automotive wholesales are financed (primarily by Ford Credit) immediately upon the sale of vehicles to dealers, which generally occurs shortly after being produced. In contrast, our Automotive trade payables are based primarily on industry-standard production supplier payment terms of about 45 days. As a result, our cash flow deteriorates if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) decrease while trade payables continue to become due. Conversely, our cash flow improves if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) increase while new trade payables are generally not due for about 45 days. For example, the suspension of production at most of our assembly plants and lower industry volumes due to COVID-19 in early 2020 resulted in an initial deterioration of our cash flow, while the subsequent resumption of manufacturing operations and return to pre-COVID-19 production levels at most of our assembly plants resulted in a subsequent improvement of our cash flow. Even in normal economic conditions, however, these working capital balances generally are subject to seasonal changes that can impact cash flow. For example, we typically experience cash flow timing differences associated with inventories and payables due to our annual summer and December shutdown periods when production, and therefore inventories and wholesale volumes, are usually at their lowest levels, while payables continue to come due and be paid. The net impact of this typically results in cash outflows from changes in our working capital balances during these shutdown periods. \n",

      " Our finished product inventory at December 31, 2022 was higher year over year due to production and release scheduling, which resulted in higher sales inventory, in-transit inventory, and units awaiting upfit. \n",

      " In response to, or in anticipation of, supplier disruptions, we may stockpile certain components or raw materials to help prevent disruption in our production of vehicles. Such actions could have a short-term adverse impact on our cash and increase our inventory. Moreover, in order to secure critical materials for production of electric vehicles, we have entered into and plan to continue to enter into offtake agreements with raw material suppliers and make investments in certain raw material and battery suppliers, including contributing up to 6.6 billion in capital to BlueOval SK, LLC over a five-year period ending in 2026. Such investments, which are part of our plan to invest over 50 billion in electric vehicles through 2026, could have an additional adverse impact on our cash in the near-term. \n",
      " \n",
      " The terms of the offtake agreements we have entered into, and those we may enter into in the future, vary by transaction, though they generally obligate us to purchase a certain percentage or minimum amount of output produced by the counterparty over an agreed upon period of time. The purchase price mechanism included in the offtake agreement is typically based on the market price of the material at the time of delivery. The terms also may include conditions to our obligation to purchase the materials, such as quality or minimum output. Subject to satisfaction of those conditions, we will be obligated to purchase the materials at the cost determined by the purchase price mechanism. Based on the offtake agreements we have entered into thus far, the earliest date by which we could be obligated to purchase any output, subject to satisfaction of the applicable conditions, will be in 2024. \n",

The non-GAAP measures listed below are intended to be considered by users as supplemental information to their equivalent GAAP measures, to aid investors in better understanding our financial results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful perspective on underlying operating results and trends, and a means to compare our period-over-period results. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Ford Credit Debt), taxes, and pre-tax special items. This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it focuses on underlying operating results and trends, and improves comparability of our period-over-period results. Our management ordinarily excludes special items from its review of the results of the operating segments for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources. Our categories of pre-tax special items and the applicable significance guideline for each item (which may consist of a group of items related to a single event or action) are as follows: \n",

The measure excludes cash outflows for funded pension contributions, global redesign (including separations), and other items that are considered operating cash flows under U.S. GAAP. This measure is useful to management and investors because it is consistent with management s assessment of the Company s operating cash flow performance. When we provide guidance for Company adjusted free cash flow, we do not provide guidance for net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities because the GAAP measure will include items that are difficult to quantify or predict with reasonable certainty, including cash flows related to the Company's exposures to foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices (separate from any related hedges), Ford Credit's operating cash flows, and cash flows related to special items, including separation payments, each of which individually or in the aggregate could have a significant impact to our net cash provided by/(used in) our operating activities. \n",

      "We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. \n",

We provide base warranties on the products we sell for specific periods of time and/or mileage, which vary depending upon the type of product and the geographic location of its sale. Separately, we also periodically perform field service actions related to safety recalls, emission recalls, and other product campaigns. Pursuant to these warranties and field service actions, we will repair, replace, or adjust parts on a vehicle that are defective in factory-supplied materials or workmanship. We accrue the estimated cost of both base warranty coverages and field service actions at the time of sale. In addition, from time to time, we issue extended warranties at our expense, the estimated cost of which is accrued at the time of issuance. \n",
      " \n",
      " Assumptions and Approach Used. We establish our estimate of base warranty obligations using a patterned estimation model. We use historical information regarding the nature, frequency, and average cost of claims for each vehicle line by model year. We reevaluate our estimate of base warranty obligations on a regular basis. Experience has shown that initial data for any given model year may be volatile; therefore, our process relies on long-term historical averages until sufficient data are available. With actual experience, we use the data to update the historical averages. We then compare the resulting accruals with present spending rates to assess whether the balances are adequate to meet expected future obligations. Based on this data, we update our estimates as necessary. \n",

      " \n",
      " Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Our expected long-term rate of return considers inputs from a range of advisors for capital market returns, inflation, bond yields, and other variables, adjusted for specific aspects of our investment strategy by plan. Historical returns also are considered when appropriate. The assumption is based on consideration of all inputs, with a focus on long-term trends to avoid short-term market influences. \n",

Non-U.S. actual return on assets was negative 25.40 , which was lower than the expected long-term rate of return of 3.29 . The lower returns are explained by losses on fixed income and growth assets, both of which were consistent with broader market performance. In total, higher rates and pension asset losses, in addition to demographic and other updates, resulted in a net remeasurement loss of 1.3 billion, which has been recognized within net periodic benefit cost and reported as a special item. \n",

      " De-risking Strategy . We employ a broad de-risking strategy for our global funded plans that increases the matching characteristics of our assets relative to our obligation as funded status improves. Changes in interest rates, which directly influence changes in discount rates, in addition to other factors have a significant impact on the value of our pension obligation and fixed income asset portfolio. Our de-risking strategy has increased the allocation to fixed income investments and reduced our funded status sensitivity to changes in interest rates.

These tax laws and regulations are complex and involve uncertainties in the application to our facts and circumstances that may be open to interpretation. We recognize benefits for these uncertain tax positions based upon a process that requires judgment regarding the technical application of the laws, regulations, and various related judicial opinions. If, in our judgment, it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50 that the uncertain tax position will be settled favorably for us, we estimate an amount that ultimately will be realized. This process is inherently subjective since it requires our assessment of the probability of future outcomes. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis, including consideration of changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial opinions, as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities.

      " \n",
      " Nature, frequency, and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses. A pattern of objectively measured recent financial reporting losses is heavily weighted as a source of negative evidence. We generally consider cumulative pre-tax losses in the three-year period ending with the current quarter to be significant negative evidence regarding future profitability. We also consider the strength and trend of earnings, as well as other relevant factors. In certain circumstances, historical information may not be as relevant due to changes in our business operations; \n",
      " \n",
      " Sources of future taxable income. Future reversals of existing temporary differences are heavily weighted sources of objectively verifiable positive evidence. Projections of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences are a source of positive evidence only when the projections are combined with a history of recent profits and can be reasonably estimated. Otherwise, these projections are considered inherently subjective and generally will not be sufficient to overcome negative evidence that includes relevant cumulative losses in recent years, particularly if the projected future taxable income is dependent on an anticipated turnaround to profitability that has not yet been achieved. In such cases, we generally give these projections of future taxable income no weight for the purposes of our valuation allowance assessment; and \n",

      " In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider the trade-offs between cash preservation and cash outlays to preserve tax credits. During 2022, we reversed 405 million of U.S. valuation allowances primarily as a result of planning actions. We presently believe that global valuation allowances of 822 million are required and that we ultimately will recover the remaining 14 billion of deferred tax assets.

Our asset groups presently are the regional Automotive business units (i.e., North America, South America, Europe, China (including Taiwan), and the International Markets Group), Ford Credit, and the separate legal entities within the Mobility segment. Asset groupings for impairment analysis are reevaluated when events occur, such as changes in organizational structure and management reporting.

      " Nature of Estimates Required - Held-and-Used Long-Lived Assets. We test our long-lived asset groups when changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable. Events that trigger a test for recoverability include material adverse changes in projected revenues or expenses, present cash flow losses combined with a history of cash flow losses and a forecast that demonstrates significant continuing losses, significant negative industry or economic trends (including a substantial shift in consumer preference), a current expectation that a long-lived asset group will be disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life, a significant adverse change in the manner in which an asset group is used or in its physical condition, or when there is a change in the asset grouping. In addition, investing in new, emerging products (e.g., EVs) or services (e.g., connectivity) may require substantial upfront investment, which may result in initial forecasted negative cash flows in the near term. In these instances, near term negative cash flows on their own may not be indicative of a triggering event for evaluation of impairment. In such circumstances we also conduct a qualitative evaluation of the business growth trajectory, which includes updating our assessment of when positive cash flows are expected to be generated, confirming whether established milestones are being achieved, and assessing our ability and intent to continue to access required funding to execute the plan. If this evaluation indicates a triggering event has occurred, a test for recoverability is performed. \n",

If the undiscounted forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, the asset group s fair value is measured relying primarily on a discounted cash flow method. To the extent available, we will also consider third-party valuations of our long-lived assets that were prepared for other business purposes. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value.

When market prices are not available, we generally estimate the fair value of the asset group using the income approach and/or the market approach. The income approach uses cash flow projections. Inherent in our development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results, business plan forecasts, expected growth rates, and cost of capital, similar to those a market participant would use to assess fair value. We also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions and other data. Many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management, and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods. \n",

      " Sensitivity Analysis. For returned vehicles, Ford Credit faces a risk that the amount it obtains from the vehicle sold at auction will be less than its estimate of the expected residual value for the vehicle. The impact of the change in assumptions on future auction values and return volumes would increase or decrease accumulated supplemental depreciation and depreciation expense over the remaining terms of the operating leases; however, the impact may be tempered or exacerbated based on future auction values in relation to the purchase price specified in the lease contract. A change in the assumption for an auction value will impact Ford Credit s estimate of accumulated supplemental depreciation if the future auction value is lower than the purchase price specified in the lease contract. The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions for Ford Credit s U.S. Ford and Lincoln operating lease portfolio is as follows (in millions): Assumption Basis Point \n",

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \\n\\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \\n \\n In the first quarter of 2023, the net income attributable to Ford Motor Company was 1,757 million, and Company adjusted EBIT was 3,379 million. \\n \\n Net income/(loss) includes certain items special items that are excluded from Company adjusted EBIT. These items are discussed in more detail in Note 21 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. We report special items separately to allow investors analyzing our results to identify certain infrequent significant items that they may wish to exclude when considering the trend of ongoing operating results. Our pre-tax and tax special items were as follows (in millions): \\n First Quarter 2022 2023 Restructuring Europe (22) (370) China (309) Ford Credit - Brazil (119) Other (36) 12 Subtotal Restructuring (177) (667) Pension and OPEB Gain/(Loss) Pension and OPEB remeasurement (113) Pension settlements and curtailments (46) Subtotal Pension and OPEB Gain/(Loss) (159) Other Items Gain/(loss) on Rivian investment \\n (5,449) (25) Russia suspension of operations/asset write-off (138) Patent matters related to prior calendar years \\n (135) Other 33 (61) Subtotal Other Items (5,689) (86) Total EBIT Special Items (5,866) (912) Provision for/(Benefit from) tax special items (a) (1,192) (144) \\n __________ \\n (a) Includes related tax effect on special items and tax special items. \\n \\n We recorded 912 million of pre-tax special item charges in the first quarter of 2023, driven primarily by restructuring actions in Europe and China. \\n \\n In Note 21 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, special items are reflected as a separate reconciling item, as opposed to being allocated among our segments. This reflects the fact that management excludes these items from its review of operating segment results for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources. \\n 33 \\n\\nItem 2.

Company adjusted EBIT margin was 8.1 in the first quarter of 2023, up 1.4 percentage points from a year ago. \\n \\n The year-over-year increase of 4.9 billion in net income/(loss) in the first quarter of 2023 was driven by the non-recurrence of a mark-to-market loss on our Rivian investment (included in special items in the first quarter of 2022) and higher Ford Blue and Ford Pro EBIT. The year-over-year increase of 1.1 billion in Company adjusted EBIT was driven by higher Ford Blue and Ford Pro EBIT as well as a lower loss in Ford Next. Partial offsets included lower Ford Credit EBT, lower past service pension and OPEB income in Corporate Other, and lower Ford Model e EBIT. \\n \\n The table below shows our first quarter 2023 net income/(loss) attributable to Ford and Company adjusted EBIT by segment. \\n First Quarter 2022 2023 H / (L) Ford Blue 1,328 2,623 1,295 Ford Model e (380) (722) (342) Ford Pro 491 1,366 875 Ford Next (242) (44) 198 Ford Credit 928 303 (625) Corporate Other 201 (147) (348) Company Adjusted EBIT (a) 2,326 3,379 1,053 Interest on Debt (308) (308) Special Items (5,866) (912) (4,954) Taxes / Noncontrolling Interests 738 (402) 1,140 Net Income/(Loss) (3,110) 1,757 4,867 \\n __________ \\n (a) See Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations section for reconciliation to GAAP. \\n 34 \\n\\nItem 2.

First quarter 2023 revenue increased 21 , driven by favorable mix as well as higher wholesales and net pricing, offset partially by weaker currencies. \\n \\n Ford Blue s first quarter 2023 EBIT was 2.6 billion, an increase of 1.3 billion from a year ago, with an EBIT margin of 10.4 . The higher EBIT was driven by favorable mix as well as higher wholesales and net pricing. Partial offsets included inflationary cost increases on commodities, materials, and freight, higher material costs for new products, as well as higher volume-related structural costs, weaker currencies, and higher warranty costs. \\n 35 \\n\\nItem 2.

First quarter 2023 revenue decreased 27 , primarily driven by lower wholesales, offset partially by favorable mix. \\n \\n Ford Model e s first quarter 2023 EBIT loss was 722 million, a 342 million higher loss than a year ago, with an EBIT margin of negative 102.1 . The lower EBIT was driven by higher engineering and spending-related expense, inflationary cost increases on commodities and materials, and lower wholesales. \\n\\nFord Pro Segment \\n First Quarter Key Metrics 2022 2023 H / (L) Wholesale Units (000) (a) 285 337 53 Revenue M) 10,324 13,249 2,925 EBIT M) 491 1,366 875 EBIT Margin ) 4.8 10.3 5.6 ppts \\n __________ \\n (a) Includes Ford brand vehicles produced and sold by our unconsolidated affiliate Ford Otosan in T rkiye (about 13,000 units in Q1 2022 and 22,000 units in Q1 2023). \\n \\n Change in EBIT by Causal Factor (in millions) First Quarter 2022 EBIT 491 Volume / Mix 497 Net Pricing 1,505 Cost (1,025) Exchange (58) Other (44) First Quarter 2023 EBIT 1,366 \\n \\n In the first quarter of 2023, Ford Pro s wholesales increased 18 from a year ago, driven by improvements in production-related supply constraints (including semiconductors).

The improvement in EBIT was driven by higher net pricing and wholesales. Partial offsets included inflationary cost increases (including commodities), new Super Duty product and launch expense, as well as higher volume-related structural costs, weaker currencies, and higher warranty costs. \\n 36 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Definitions and Information Regarding Ford Blue, Ford Model e, Ford Pro Causal Factors \\n \\n In general, we measure year-over-year change in Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro EBIT using the causal factors listed below, with net pricing and cost variances calculated at present-period volume and mix and exchange: \\n \\n Market Factors (exclude the impact of unconsolidated affiliate wholesale units): \\n Volume and Mix primarily measures EBIT variance from changes in wholesale unit volumes (at prior-year average contribution margin per unit) driven by changes in industry volume, market share, and dealer stocks, as well as the EBIT variance resulting from changes in product mix, including mix among vehicle lines and mix of trim levels and options within a vehicle line \\n Net Pricing primarily measures EBIT variance driven by changes in wholesale unit prices to dealers and marketing incentive programs such as rebate programs, low-rate financing offers, special lease offers, and stock adjustments on dealer inventory \\n \\n Cost: \\n Contribution Costs primarily measures EBIT variance driven by per-unit changes in cost categories that typically vary with volume, such as material costs (including commodity and component costs), warranty expense, and freight and duty costs \\n Structural Costs primarily measures EBIT variance driven by absolute change in cost categories that typically do not have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume. Structural costs include the following cost categories: \\n Manufacturing, Including Volume-Related consists primarily of costs for hourly and salaried manufacturing personnel, plant overhead (such as utilities and taxes), and new product launch expense. These costs could be affected by volume for operating pattern actions such as overtime, line-speed, and shift schedules \\n Engineering and Connectivity consists primarily of costs for vehicle and software engineering personnel, prototype materials, testing, and outside engineering and software services \\n Spending-Related consists primarily of depreciation and amortization of our manufacturing and engineering assets and capital project expense, but also includes asset retirements and operating leases \\n Advertising and Sales Promotions includes costs for advertising, marketing programs, brand promotions, customer mailings and promotional events, and auto shows \\n Administrative, Information Technology, and Selling includes primarily costs for salaried personnel and purchased services related to our staff activities, information technology, and selling functions \\n \\n Exchange primarily measures EBIT variance driven by one or more of the following: (i) transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the relevant entities, (ii) effects of converting functional currency income to U.S. dollars, (iii) effects of remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities of the relevant entities in currencies other than their functional currency, or (iv) results of our foreign currency hedging \\n \\n Other includes a variety of items, such as parts and services earnings, royalties, government incentives, and compensation-related changes \\n \\n In addition, definitions and calculations used in this report include: \\n \\n Wholesales and Revenue wholesale unit volumes include all Ford and Lincoln badged units (whether produced by Ford or by an unconsolidated affiliate) that are sold to dealerships or others, units manufactured by Ford that are sold to other manufacturers, units distributed by Ford for other manufacturers, and local brand units produced by our China joint venture, Jiangling Motors Corporation, Ltd. JMC ), that are sold to dealerships or others. Vehicles sold to daily rental car companies that are subject to a guaranteed repurchase option (i.e., rental repurchase), as well as other sales of finished vehicles for which the recognition of revenue is deferred (e.g., consignments), also are included in wholesale unit volumes. Revenue from certain vehicles in wholesale unit volumes (specifically, Ford badged vehicles produced and distributed by our unconsolidated affiliates, as well as JMC brand vehicles) are not included in our revenue. Excludes transactions between Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro segments \\n \\n Industry Volume and Market Share based, in part, on estimated vehicle registrations; includes medium and heavy duty trucks \\n \\n SAAR seasonally adjusted annual rate \\n 37 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Ford Next Segment \\n \\n The Ford Next segment (formerly Mobility) primarily includes expenses and investments for emerging business initiatives aimed at creating value for Ford in vehicle-adjacent market segments. \\n \\n In this segment, our first quarter 2023 EBIT loss was 44 million, a 198 million improvement from a year ago. Ford Next has evolved from primarily investing in the development of autonomous vehicle capabilities to focus exclusively on incubating and launching new businesses creating strategic value for Ford. \\n 38 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Ford Credit Segment \\n \\n Ford Credit files periodic reports with the SEC that contain additional information regarding Ford Credit. The reports are available through Ford Credit s website located at www.fordcredit.com/investor-center and can also be found on the SEC s website located at www.sec.gov . The foregoing information regarding Ford Credit s website and its content is for convenience only and not deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Report nor filed with the SEC. \\n \\n The tables below provide first quarter 2023 key metrics and the change in first quarter 2023 EBT compared with first quarter 2022 by causal factor for the Ford Credit segment. For a description of these causal factors, see Definitions and Information Regarding Ford Credit Causal Factors. \\n First Quarter Key Metrics 2022 2023 H / (L) Total Net Receivables B) 117 124 6 Loss-to-Receivables (bps) (a) 8 35 27 Auction Values (b) 34,410 31,185 (9) EBT M) 928 303 (625) ROE ) 22 8 (14) ppts Other Balance Sheet Metrics Debt B) 116 120 4 Net Liquidity B) 28 26 (8) Financial Statement Leverage (to 1) 9.5 9.8 0.3 \\n __________ \\n (a) U.S. retail financing only. \\n (b) U.S. 36-month off-lease first quarter auction values at Q1 2023 mix. \\n \\n Change in EBT by Causal Factor (in millions) First Quarter 2022 EBT 928 Volume / Mix 23 Financing Margin (288) Credit Loss (141) Lease Residual (139) Exchange (8) Other (72) First Quarter 2023 EBT 303 \\n \\n Ford Credit s total net receivables of 124 billion were 7 billion higher than a year ago, reflecting the impact of increased non-consumer financing and consumer financing, partially offset by fewer operating leases. The loss-to-receivables LTR ratio remained at a low level in the first quarter of 2023, at 35 basis points, though higher than a year ago as losses begin to normalize from historic lows. U.S. auction values in the first quarter of 2023 were lower compared to a year ago. \\n \\n Ford Credit s first quarter 2023 EBT of 303 million was 625 million lower than a year ago, primarily reflecting lower financing margin due to higher borrowing costs, higher credit losses, the non-recurrence of credit loss reserve releases, unfavorable lease residual performance, the non-recurrence of market valuation gains, and unfavorable market valuation adjustments to derivatives (included in Other). \\n 39 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Definitions and Information Regarding Ford Credit Causal Factors \\n \\n In general, we measure year-over-year changes in Ford Credit s EBT using the causal factors listed below: \\n \\n Volume and Mix: \\n Volume primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by changes in average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses at prior period financing margin yield (defined below in financing margin) at prior period exchange rates. Volume changes are primarily driven by the volume of new and used vehicles sold and leased, the extent to which Ford Credit purchases retail financing and operating lease contracts, the extent to which Ford Credit provides wholesale financing, the sales price of the vehicles financed, the level of dealer inventories, Ford-sponsored special financing programs available exclusively through Ford Credit, and the availability of cost-effective funding \\n Mix primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by period-over-period changes in the composition of Ford Credit s average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses by product within each region \\n \\n Financing Margin: \\n Financing margin variance is the period-to-period change in financing margin yield multiplied by the present period average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses at prior period exchange rates. This calculation is performed at the product and country level and then aggregated. Financing margin yield equals revenue, less interest expense and scheduled depreciation for the period, divided by average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses for the same period \\n Financing margin changes are driven by changes in revenue and interest expense. Changes in revenue are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, cost assumptions in pricing, mix of business, and competitive environment. Changes in interest expense are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, borrowing spreads, and asset-liability management \\n \\n Credit Loss: \\n Credit loss is the change in the provision for credit losses at prior period exchange rates. For analysis purposes, management splits the provision for credit losses into net charge-offs and the change in the allowance for credit losses \\n Net charge-off changes are primarily driven by the number of repossessions, severity per repossession, and recoveries. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are primarily driven by changes in historical trends in credit losses and recoveries, changes in the composition and size of Ford Credit s present portfolio, changes in trends in historical used vehicle values, and changes in forward looking macroeconomic conditions. For additional information, refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates - Allowance for Credit Losses section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2022 Form 10-K Report \\n \\n Lease Residual: \\n Lease residual measures changes to residual performance at prior period exchange rates. For analysis purposes, management splits residual performance primarily into residual gains and losses, and the change in accumulated supplemental depreciation \\n Residual gain and loss changes are primarily driven by the number of vehicles returned to Ford Credit and sold, and the difference between the auction value and the depreciated value (which includes both base and accumulated supplemental depreciation) of the vehicles sold. Changes in accumulated supplemental depreciation are primarily driven by changes in Ford Credit s estimate of the expected auction value at the end of the lease term and changes in Ford Credit s estimate of the number of vehicles that will be returned to it and sold. Depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases includes early termination losses on operating leases due to customer default events. For additional information, refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates - Accumulated Depreciation on Vehicles Subject to Operating Leases section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2022 Form 10-K Report \\n \\n Exchange: \\n Reflects changes in EBT driven by the effects of converting functional currency income to U.S. dollars \\n \\n Other: \\n Primarily includes operating expenses, other revenue, insurance expenses, and other income/(loss) at prior period exchange rates \\n Changes in operating expenses are primarily driven by salaried personnel costs, facilities costs, and costs associated with the origination and servicing of customer contracts \\n In general, other income/(loss) changes are primarily driven by changes in earnings related to market valuation adjustments to derivatives (primarily related to movements in interest rates) and other miscellaneous items \\n 40 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n In addition, the following definitions and calculations apply to Ford Credit when used in this Report: \\n \\n Cash (as shown in the Funding Structure and Liquidity tables) Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, excluding amounts related to insurance activities \\n \\n Debt (as shown in the Key Metrics and Leverage tables) Debt on Ford Credit s balance sheets. Includes debt issued in securitizations and payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets and related enhancements. Ford Credit holds the right to receive the excess cash flows not needed to pay the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions \\n \\n Earnings Before Taxes EBT Reflects Ford Credit s income before income taxes \\n \\n Loss-to-Receivables LTR Ratio LTR ratio is calculated using net charge-offs divided by average finance receivables, excluding unearned interest supplements and the allowance for credit losses \\n \\n Return on Equity ROE (as shown in the Key Metrics table) Reflects return on equity calculated by annualizing net income for the period and dividing by monthly average equity for the period \\n \\n Securitization and Restricted Cash (as shown in the Liquidity table) Securitization cash is held for the benefit of the securitization investors (for example, a reserve fund). Restricted cash primarily includes cash held to meet certain local governmental and regulatory reserve requirements and cash held under the terms of certain contractual agreements \\n \\n Securitizations (as shown in the Public Term Funding Plan table) Public securitization transactions, Rule 144A offerings sponsored by Ford Credit, and widely distributed offerings by Ford Credit Canada \\n \\n Term Asset-Backed Securities (as shown in the Funding Structure table) Obligations issued in securitization transactions that are payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets and related enhancements \\n \\n Total Net Receivables (as shown in the Key Metrics table) Includes finance receivables (retail financing and wholesale) sold for legal purposes and net investment in operating leases included in securitization transactions that do not satisfy the requirements for accounting sale treatment. These receivables and operating leases are reported on Ford Credit s balance sheets and are available only for payment of the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions; they are not available to pay the other obligations of Ford Credit or the claims of Ford Credit s other creditors \\n\\n41 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Corporate Other \\n \\n Corporate Other primarily includes corporate governance expenses, past service pension and OPEB income and expense, interest income (excluding Ford Credit interest income and interest earned on our extended service contract portfolio) and gains and losses from our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding gains and losses on investments in equity securities), and foreign exchange derivatives gains and losses associated with intercompany lending. Corporate governance expenses are primarily administrative, delivering benefit on behalf of the global enterprise, that are not allocated to operating segments. These include expenses related to setting and directing global policy, providing oversight and stewardship, and promoting the Company s interests. In the first quarter of 2023, Corporate Other had a 147 million loss, compared with a 201 million profit a year ago. The loss was driven by lower past service pension and OPEB income, which was partially offset by higher Company excluding Ford Credit interest income due to increases in interest rates (primarily Fed Funds). \\n\\nInterest on Debt \\n \\n Interest on Debt, which consists of interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit, was 308 million in the first quarter of 2023, unchanged from a year ago. \\n\\nTaxes \\n \\n Our Provision for/(Benefit from) income taxes for the first quarter of 2023 was a provision of 496 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 23.0 . \\n \\n Our first quarter 2023 adjusted effective tax rate, which excludes special items, was 20.8 . \\n \\n We regularly review our organizational structure and income tax elections for affiliates in non-U.S. and U.S. tax jurisdictions, which may result in changes in affiliates that are included in or excluded from our U.S. tax return. Any future changes to our structure, as well as any changes in income tax laws in the countries that we operate, could cause increases or decreases to our deferred tax balances and related valuation allowances. \\n 42 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \\n \\n At March 31, 2023, total balance sheet cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash, including Ford Credit and entities held for sale, was 39.7 billion. \\n \\n We consider our key balance sheet metrics to be: (i) Company cash, which includes cash equivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash, including cash held for sale, excluding Ford Credit s cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash; and (ii) Company liquidity, which includes Company cash, less restricted cash, and total available committed credit lines, excluding Ford Credit s total available committed credit lines. \\n \\n Company excluding Ford Credit \\n December 31, 2022 March 31, 2023 Balance Sheets B) \\n Company Cash 32.3 28.7 Liquidity 48.0 46.2 Debt (19.9) (19.7) Cash Net of Debt 12.3 9.0 Pension Funded Status B) (a) \\n Funded Plans 4.1 4.1 Unfunded Plans (4.3) (4.3) Total Global Pension (0.2) (0.2) Total Funded Status OPEB (4.5) (4.4) \\n __________ \\n (a) Balances at March 31, 2023 reflect net funded status at December 31, 2022, updated for service and interest cost; expected return on assets; curtailments, settlements, and associated interim remeasurement (where applicable); separation expense; actual benefit payments; and cash contributions. The discount rate and rate of expected return assumptions are unchanged from year-end 2022. \\n \\n Liquidity . One of our key priorities is to maintain a strong balance sheet, while at the same time having resources available to invest in and grow our business. At March 31, 2023, we had Company cash of 28.7 billion and liquidity of 46.2 billion. At March 31, 2023, about 90 of Company cash was held by consolidated entities domiciled in the United States. \\n \\n To be prepared for an economic downturn, we target an ongoing Company cash balance at or above 20 billion plus significant additional liquidity above our Company cash target. We expect to have periods when we will be above or below this amount due to: (i) future cash flow expectations, such as for investments in future opportunities, capital investments, debt maturities, pension contributions, or restructuring requirements, (ii) short-term timing differences, and (iii) changes in the global economic environment. \\n \\n Our Company cash investments primarily include U.S. Department of Treasury obligations, federal agency securities, bank time deposits with investment-grade institutions, investment-grade corporate securities, investment-grade commercial paper, and debt obligations of a select group of non-U.S. governments, non-U.S. governmental agencies, and supranational institutions. The average maturity of these investments is approximately one year and adjusted based on market conditions and liquidity needs. We monitor our Company cash levels and average maturity on a daily basis. \\n 43 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Material Cash Requirements. Our material cash requirements include: \\n \\n Capital expenditures (for additional information, see the Changes in Company Cash section below) and other payments for engineering, software, product development, and implementation of our plans for battery electric vehicles \\n \\n Purchase of raw materials and components to support the manufacturing and sale of vehicles (including electric vehicles), parts, and accessories (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table and the accompanying description of our Purchase obligations in the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Company Excluding Ford Credit section in Item 7 of our 2022 Form 10-K Report) \\n \\n Marketing incentive payments to dealers \\n \\n Payments for warranty and field service actions (for additional information, see Note 20 of the Notes to the Financial Statements herein) \\n \\n Debt repayments (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table in the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Company Excluding Ford Credit section in Item 7 and Note 19 of the Notes the Financial Statements in our 2022 Form 10-K Report) \\n \\n Discretionary and mandatory payments to our global pension plans (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table in the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Company Excluding Ford Credit section in Item 7 of our 2022 Form 10-K Report, the Changes in Company Cash section below, and Note 13 of the Notes to the Financial Statements herein) \\n \\n Employee wages, benefits, and incentives \\n \\n Operating lease payments (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table in the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Company Excluding Ford Credit section in Item 7 and Note 18 of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2022 Form 10-K Report) \\n \\n Cash effects related to the restructuring of our business \\n \\n Strategic acquisitions and investments to grow our business, including electrification \\n \\n Subject to approval by our Board of Directors, shareholder distributions in the form of dividend payments and/or a share repurchase program (including share repurchases to offset the anti-dilutive effect of increased shared-based compensation) may require the expenditure of a material amount of cash. Moreover, we may be subject to additional material cash requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, e.g., legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions, and other matters. \\n \\n We plan to utilize our liquidity (as described above) and our cash flows from business operations to fund our material cash requirements. \\n\\n44 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Changes in Company Cash. In managing our business, we classify changes in Company cash into operating and non-operating items. Operating items include: Company adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit EBT, capital spending, depreciation and tooling amortization, changes in working capital, Ford Credit distributions, interest on debt, cash taxes, and all other and timing differences (including timing differences between accrual-based EBIT and associated cash flows). Non-operating items include: restructuring costs, changes in Company debt excluding Ford Credit, contributions to funded pension plans, shareholder distributions, and other items (including gains and losses on investments in equity securities, acquisitions and divestitures, equity investments, and other transactions with Ford Credit). \\n \\n With respect to Changes in working capital, in general, the Company excluding Ford Credit carries relatively low trade receivables compared with our trade payables because the majority of our wholesales are financed (primarily by Ford Credit) immediately upon the sale of vehicles to dealers, which generally occurs shortly after being produced. In contrast, our trade payables are based primarily on industry-standard production supplier payment terms of about 45 days. As a result, our cash flow deteriorates if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) decrease while trade payables continue to become due. Conversely, our cash flow improves if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) increase while new trade payables are generally not due for about 45 days. For example, the suspension of production at most of our assembly plants and lower industry volumes due to COVID-19 in early 2020 resulted in an initial deterioration of our cash flow, while the subsequent resumption of manufacturing operations and return to pre-COVID-19 production levels at most of our assembly plants resulted in a subsequent improvement of our cash flow. Even in normal economic conditions, however, these working capital balances generally are subject to seasonal changes that can impact cash flow. For example, we typically experience cash flow timing differences associated with inventories and payables due to our annual summer and December shutdown periods when production, and therefore inventories and wholesale volumes, are usually at their lowest levels, while payables continue to come due and be paid. The net impact of this typically results in cash outflows from changes in our working capital balances during these shutdown periods. \\n \\n Our finished product inventory at March 31, 2023 was higher than at December 31, 2022, reflecting higher in-transit and in-plant inventory. \\n \\n In response to, or in anticipation of, supplier disruptions, we may stockpile certain components or raw materials to help prevent disruption in our production of vehicles. Such actions could have a short-term adverse impact on our cash and increase our inventory. Moreover, in order to secure critical materials for production of electric vehicles, we have entered into and plan to continue to enter into offtake agreements with raw material suppliers and make investments in certain raw material and battery suppliers, including contributing up to 6.6 billion in capital to BlueOval SK, LLC over a five-year period ending in 2026. Such investments, which are part of our plan to invest over 50 billion in electric vehicles through 2026, could have an additional adverse impact on our cash in the near-term. \\n \\n The terms of the offtake agreements we have entered into, and those we may enter into in the future, vary by transaction, though they generally obligate us to purchase a certain percentage or minimum amount of output produced by the counterparty over an agreed upon period of time. The purchase price mechanism included in the offtake agreement is typically based on the market price of the material at the time of delivery. The terms may also include conditions to our obligation to purchase the materials, such as quality or minimum output. Subject to satisfaction of those conditions, we will be obligated to purchase the materials at the cost determined by the purchase price mechanism. As of March 31, 2023, our forecasted expenditures for the maximum quantity that we are committed to purchase under these offtake agreements, subject to certain conditions, total about 4.3 billion through 2030 based on our present pricing forecast; however, our forecasted prices could fluctuate significantly from period to period, which would result in volatility in the estimate of our overall obligation. In addition, we plan to continue to enter into offtake agreements with raw material suppliers, the costs under which we expect to be significant. Based on the offtake agreements we have entered into thus far, the earliest date by which we could be obligated to purchase any output, subject to satisfaction of the applicable conditions, will be in 2024. \\n \\n Financial institutions participate in a supply chain finance SCF program that enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their Ford receivables (i.e., our payment obligations to the suppliers) to the financial institutions on a non-recourse basis in order to be paid earlier than our payment terms provide. Our suppliers voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms, the amounts we pay, or our liquidity. We have no economic interest in a supplier s decision to participate in the SCF program, and we do not provide any guarantees in connection with it. As of March 31, 2023, the outstanding amount of Ford receivables that suppliers elected to sell to the SCF financial institutions was 265 million. The amount settled through the SCF program during the first quarter of 2023 was 452 million. \\n\\n45 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Changes in Company cash excluding Ford Credit are summarized below (in billions): \\n First Quarter 2022 2023 Company Excluding Ford Credit Company Adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit (a) 1.4 3.1 Capital spending (1.3) (1.8) Depreciation and tooling amortization 1.3 1.3 Net spending (0.1) (0.5) Receivables 0.4 Inventory (2.7) (2.0) Trade Payables 1.5 0.3 Changes in working capital (1.2) (1.2) Ford Credit distributions 1.0 Interest on debt and cash taxes (0.3) (0.6) All other and timing differences (1.3) (0.1) Company adjusted free cash flow (a) (0.6) 0.7 Restructuring (0.1) Changes in debt (0.3) (0.2) Funded pension contributions (0.2) (0.1) Shareholder distributions (0.4) (3.2) All other (b) (6.2) (0.7) Change in cash (7.8) (3.6) \\n __________ \\n (a) See Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations section for reconciliation to GAAP. \\n (b) 2022 includes a 5.4B mark-to-market loss on our Rivian investment. \\n Note: Numbers may not sum due to rounding. \\n \\n Our first quarter 2023 Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities was positive 2.8 billion, an increase of 3.9 billion from a year ago (see page 58 for additional information), driven primarily by higher net income. Company adjusted free cash flow was 0.7 billion, 1.3 billion higher than a year ago, driven by higher adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit and favorable timing differences, offset partially by lower Ford Credit distributions and higher capital spending. \\n \\n Capital spending was 1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2023, an increase of 0.4 billion from a year ago. We continue to expect full year 2023 capital spending to be in the range of 8 billion to 9 billion. \\n \\n First quarter 2023 working capital impact was 1.2 billion negative, driven by higher inventory, offset partially by higher trade payables and lower receivables, each compared to December 31, 2022. All other and timing differences were negative 0.1 billion. Timing differences include differences between accrual-based EBIT and the associated cash flows (e.g., pension and OPEB income or expense; compensation payments; marketing incentive and warranty payments to dealers). \\n \\n In the first quarter of 2023, we contributed 125 million to our global funded pension plans. We continue to expect to contribute between 500 million and 600 million to our global funded pension plans in 2023. \\n \\n Shareholder distributions were 3.2 billion in the first quarter of 2023, all of which was attributable to our regular and supplemental dividend. \\n 46 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Available Credit Lines . Total Company committed credit lines, excluding Ford Credit, at March 31, 2023 were 19.3 billion, consisting of 13.5 billion of our corporate credit facility, 2.0 billion of our supplemental revolving credit facility, 1.75 billion of our 364-day revolving credit facility, and 2.1 billion of local credit facilities. At March 31, 2023, the utilized portion of the corporate credit facility was 17 million, representing amounts utilized for letters of credit. In addition, 1.7 billion of committed Company credit lines, excluding Ford Credit, was utilized under local credit facilities for our affiliates as of March 31, 2023. \\n \\n Our corporate, supplemental, and 364-day revolving credit facilities were amended as of April 26, 2023 to extend the maturity dates of the commitments under each facility. Following the corporate credit facility amendment, 3.4 billion of commitments mature on April 26, 2026 and 10.1 billion of commitments mature on April 26, 2028. Following the supplemental revolving credit facility amendment, 0.1 billion of commitments mature on September 29, 2024 and 1.9 billion of commitments mature on April 26, 2026. Following the 364-day revolving credit facility amendment, 1.8 billion of commitments mature on April 24, 2024. \\n \\n The corporate, supplemental, and 364-day credit agreements include certain sustainability-linked targets, pursuant to which the applicable margin and facility fees may be adjusted if Ford achieves, or fails to achieve, the specified targets related to global manufacturing facility greenhouse gas emissions, renewable electricity consumption, and Ford Europe CO 2 tailpipe emissions. \\n \\n The corporate credit facility is unsecured and free of material adverse change conditions to borrowing, restrictive financial covenants (for example, interest or fixed-charge coverage ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and minimum net worth requirements), and credit rating triggers that could limit our ability to obtain funding or trigger early repayment. The corporate credit facility contains a liquidity covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum of 4 billion in aggregate of domestic cash, cash equivalents, and loaned and marketable securities and/or availability under the corporate credit facility, supplemental revolving credit facility, and 364-day revolving credit facility. The terms and conditions of the supplemental and 364-day revolving credit facilities are consistent with our corporate credit facility. Ford Credit has been designated as a subsidiary borrower under the corporate credit facility and the 364-day revolving credit facility. \\n \\n Each of the corporate credit facility, supplemental revolving credit facility, and 364-day revolving credit facility include a covenant that requires us to provide guarantees from certain of our subsidiaries in the event that our senior, unsecured, long-term debt does not maintain at least two investment grade ratings from Fitch, Moody s, and S P. The following subsidiaries have provided unsecured guarantees to the lenders under the credit facilities: Ford Component Sales, LLC; Ford European Holdings Inc.; Ford Global Technologies, LLC; Ford Holdings LLC (the parent company of Ford Credit); Ford International Capital LLC; Ford Mexico Holdings LLC; Ford Motor Service Company; Ford Next LLC; Ford Trading Company, LLC; and Ford Van Dyke Investment Fund, Inc. \\n \\n Debt. As shown in Note 14 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, at March 31, 2023, Company debt excluding Ford Credit was 19.7 billion. This balance is 0.2 billion lower than at December 31, 2022. \\n \\n Leverage. We manage Company debt (excluding Ford Credit) levels with a leverage framework that targets investment grade credit ratings through a normal business cycle. The leverage framework includes a ratio of total Company debt (excluding Ford Credit), underfunded pension liabilities, operating leases, and other adjustments, divided by Company adjusted EBIT (excluding Ford Credit EBT), and further adjusted to exclude depreciation and tooling amortization (excluding Ford Credit). \\n \\n Ford Credit s leverage is calculated as a separate business as described in the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Ford Credit Segment section of Item 2. Ford Credit is self-funding and its debt, which is used to fund its operations, is separate from our Company debt excluding Ford Credit. \\n 47 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Ford Credit Segment \\n \\n Ford Credit remains well capitalized with a strong balance sheet and funding diversified across platforms and markets. Ford Credit saw sequential improvement in liquidity, securitized funding mix, and financial statement leverage during the quarter and ended the first quarter of 2023 with 26 billion of liquidity, up 5 billion from year-end. Ford Credit continues to have robust access to the capital markets, completing 12 billion of public term issuances through May 1, 2023. \\n \\n Key elements of Ford Credit s funding strategy include: \\n \\n Maintain strong liquidity and funding diversity \\n Prudently access public markets \\n Continue to leverage retail deposit funding in Europe \\n Flexibility to increase ABS mix as needed; preserving assets and committed capacity \\n Target financial statement leverage of 9:1 to 10:1 \\n Maintain self-liquidating balance sheet \\n \\n Ford Credit s liquidity profile continues to be diverse, robust, and focused on maintaining liquidity levels that meet its business and funding requirements. Ford Credit regularly stress tests its balance sheet and liquidity to ensure that it can continue to meet its financial obligations through economic cycles. \\n \\n The following table shows funding for Ford Credit s net receivables (in billions): \\n March 31, 2022 December 31, 2022 March 31, 2023 Funding Structure Term unsecured debt 55.1 48.3 49.3 Term asset-backed securities 47.1 56.4 55.0 Ford Interest Advantage / Retail Deposits 13.3 14.3 15.3 Other 1.7 2.6 2.2 Equity 12.1 11.9 12.2 Adjustments for cash (11.9) (11.2) (10.2) Total Net Receivables 117.4 122.3 123.8 Securitized Funding as Percent of Total Debt 40.8 47.4 46.0 \\n \\n Net receivables were 123.8 billion at March 31, 2023 and were funded primarily with term unsecured debt and term asset-backed securities.

At March 31, 2023, Ford Credit s net liquidity available for use was 26 billion, 5 billion higher than year-end 2022, reflecting strong access to public funding markets and the addition of 3.1 billion in committed asset-backed capacity. At March 31, 2023, Ford Credit s liquidity sources, including cash, committed asset-backed facilities, and unsecured credit facilities, totaled 53.2 billion, up 2.3 billion from year-end 2022. \\n \\n Material Cash Requirements. Ford Credit s material cash requirements include: (1) the purchase of retail financing and operating lease contracts from dealers and providing wholesale financing for dealers to finance new and used vehicles; and (2) debt repayments (for additional information on debt, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table in the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Company Excluding Ford Credit section in Item 7 and Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2022 Form 10-K Report). In addition, subject to approval by Ford Credit s Board of Directors, shareholder distributions may require the expenditure of a material amount of cash. Moreover, Ford Credit may be subject to additional material cash requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, e.g., legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions, and other matters. \\n \\n Ford Credit plans to utilize its liquidity (as described above) and its cash flows from business operations to fund its material cash requirements. \\n \\n Funding and Liquidity Risks. Ford Credit s funding plan is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control, including disruption in the capital markets, that could impact both unsecured debt and asset-backed securities issuance and the effects of regulatory changes on the financial markets. Refer to the Liquidity - Ford Credit Segment - Funding and Liquidity Risks section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2022 Form 10-K Report for more information. \\n \\n 49 \\n\\nItem 2.

As of March 31, 2023, our total Company pension underfunded status reported on our consolidated balance sheets was 0.2 billion and reflects the net funded status at December 31, 2022, updated for: service and interest cost; expected return on assets; curtailments, settlements, and associated interim remeasurement (where applicable); separation expense; actual benefit payments; and cash contributions. For plans without interim remeasurement, the discount rate and rate of expected return assumptions are unchanged from year-end 2022. \\n \\n Return on Invested Capital ROIC ).

Our actual results could differ materially from our guidance due to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including those set forth in Risk Factors in Item 1A of our 2022 Form 10-K Report and as updated by our subsequent filings with the SEC. \\n 2023 Guidance Total Company Adjusted EBIT (a) 9 - 11 billion Adjusted Free Cash Flow (a) About 6 billion Capital spending 8 - 9 billion Ford Credit EBT About 1.3 billion \\n __________ \\n (a) When we provide guidance for adjusted EBIT and adjusted free cash flow, we do not provide guidance for the most comparable GAAP measures because, as described in more detail below in Non-GAAP Measures That Supplement GAAP Measures, they include items that are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty. \\n \\n For full-year 2023, we continue to expect adjusted EBIT of 9 billion to 11 billion and adjusted free cash flow of about 6 billion. \\n \\n On a segment basis, we expect: \\n \\n Ford Blue to deliver full-year EBIT of about 7 billion. Cost improvements and higher industry volumes will likely be offset partially by pricing headwinds, as inventory stocks continue to normalize and industry incentives rise throughout the year, along with adverse exchange. \\n Ford Model e to report an EBIT loss of around 3 billion, largely reflecting disciplined investments in new products and capacity. \\n Ford Pro s EBIT to nearly double from full-year 2022 to around 6 billion. The gain is driven by improved pricing and volume, including the benefits from the launch of our all-new Super Duty. \\n Ford Credit EBT to be about 1.3 billion. \\n \\n Our outlook for 2023 assumes the headwinds and tailwinds below. \\n \\n Headwinds: \\n Global economic uncertainty \\n Higher industrywide customer incentives as vehicle supply and demand rebalances \\n Lower past service pension income and exchange \\n Growth-related investments (e.g., customer experience, connected services, and capital expenditures) \\n \\n Tailwinds: \\n Improvement in the supply chain and higher industry volume with a seasonally adjusted annual rate SAAR of about 15 million in the United States and about 13 million in Europe \\n Launch of our all-new Super Duty \\n Lower cost of goods sold, including materials and commodities \\n 52 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements \\n \\n Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations, forecasts, and assumptions by our management and involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: \\n \\n Ford and Ford Credit s financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by public health issues, including epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19; \\n Ford is highly dependent on its suppliers to deliver components in accordance with Ford s production schedule and specifications, and a shortage of or inability to acquire key components, such as semiconductors, or raw materials, such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, can disrupt Ford s production of vehicles; \\n To facilitate access to the raw materials necessary for the production of electric vehicles, Ford has entered into, and expects to continue to enter into, multi-year commitments to raw material suppliers that subject Ford to risks associated with lower future demand for such materials as well as costs that fluctuate and are difficult to accurately forecast; \\n Ford s long-term competitiveness depends on the successful execution of Ford+; \\n Ford s vehicles could be affected by defects that result in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, or increased warranty costs; \\n Ford may not realize the anticipated benefits of existing or pending strategic alliances, joint ventures, acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings, or new business strategies; \\n Operational systems, security systems, vehicles, and services could be affected by cyber incidents, ransomware attacks, and other disruptions and impact Ford and Ford Credit as well as their suppliers and dealers; \\n Ford s production, as well as Ford s suppliers production, and/or the ability to deliver products to consumers could be disrupted by labor issues, natural or man-made disasters, adverse effects of climate change, financial distress, production difficulties, capacity limitations, or other factors; \\n Ford s ability to maintain a competitive cost structure could be affected by labor or other constraints; \\n Ford s ability to attract and retain talented, diverse, and highly skilled employees is critical to its success and competitiveness; \\n Ford s new and existing products and digital, software, and physical services are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries and its reputation may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced; \\n Ford s results are dependent on sales of larger, more profitable vehicles, particularly in the United States; \\n With a global footprint, Ford s results could be adversely affected by economic or geopolitical developments, including protectionist trade policies such as tariffs, or other events; \\n Industry sales volume can be volatile and could decline if there is a financial crisis, recession, or significant geopolitical event; \\n Ford may face increased price competition or a reduction in demand for its products resulting from industry excess capacity, currency fluctuations, competitive actions, or other factors; \\n Inflationary pressure and fluctuations in commodity and energy prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and market value of Ford or Ford Credit s investments, including marketable securities, can have a significant effect on results; \\n Ford and Ford Credit s access to debt, securitization, or derivative markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts could be affected by credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, regulatory requirements, or other factors; \\n The impact of government incentives on Ford s business could be significant, and Ford s receipt of government incentives could be subject to reduction, termination, or clawback; \\n Ford Credit could experience higher-than-expected credit losses, lower-than-anticipated residual values, or higher-than-expected return volumes for leased vehicles; \\n Economic and demographic experience for pension and OPEB plans (e.g., discount rates or investment returns) could be worse than Ford has assumed; \\n Pension and other postretirement liabilities could adversely affect Ford s liquidity and financial condition; \\n Ford and Ford Credit could experience unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations, or adverse publicity arising out of alleged defects in products, services, perceived environmental impacts, or otherwise; \\n Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations; \\n Ford and Ford Credit could be affected by the continued development of more stringent privacy, data use, and data protection laws and regulations as well as consumers heightened expectations to safeguard their personal information; and \\n Ford Credit could be subject to new or increased credit regulations, consumer protection regulations, or other regulations. \\n 53 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n We cannot be certain that any expectation, forecast, or assumption made in preparing forward-looking statements will prove accurate, or that any projection will be realized. It is to be expected that there may be differences between projected and actual results. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of their initial issuance, and we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. For additional discussion, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2022 Form 10-K Report, as updated by our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. \\n 54 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT SUPPLEMENT GAAP MEASURES \\n \\n We use both generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for operational and financial decision making, and to assess Company and segment business performance. The non-GAAP measures listed below are intended to be considered by users as supplemental information to their equivalent GAAP measures, to aid investors in better understanding our financial results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful perspective on underlying operating results and trends, and a means to compare our period-over-period results. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in items or events being adjusted. \\n \\n Company Adjusted EBIT (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Income/(Loss) Attributable to Ford) Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) excludes interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), taxes, and pre-tax special items. This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it focuses on underlying operating results and trends, and improves comparability of our period-over-period results. Our management ordinarily excludes special items from its review of the results of the operating segments for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources. Our categories of pre-tax special items and the applicable significance guideline for each item (which may consist of a group of items related to a single event or action) are as follows: \\n \\n Pre-Tax Special Item Significance Guideline Pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses No minimum Gains and losses on investments in equity securities No minimum Personnel expenses, supplier- and dealer-related costs, and facility-related charges stemming from our efforts to match production capacity and cost structure to market demand and changing model mix Generally 100 million or more Other items that we do not necessarily consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities 500 million or more for individual field service actions; generally 100 million or more for other items \\n \\n When we provide guidance for adjusted EBIT, we do not provide guidance on a net income basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty, including gains and losses on pension and OPEB remeasurements and on investments in equity securities. \\n \\n Company Adjusted EBIT Margin (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Company Net Income/(Loss) Margin) Company Adjusted EBIT margin is Company adjusted EBIT divided by Company revenue. This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it allows users to evaluate our operating results aligned with industry reporting. \\n \\n Adjusted Earnings/(Loss) Per Share (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Earnings/(Loss) Per Share) Measure of Company s diluted net earnings/(loss) per share adjusted for impact of pre-tax special items (described above), tax special items, and restructuring impacts in noncontrolling interests. The measure provides investors with useful information to evaluate performance of our business excluding items not indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities. When we provide guidance for adjusted earnings/(loss) per share, we do not provide guidance on an earnings/(loss) per share basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses. \\n \\n Adjusted Effective Tax Rate (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Effective Tax Rate) Measure of Company s tax rate excluding pre-tax special items (described above) and tax special items. The measure provides an ongoing effective rate which investors find useful for historical comparisons and for forecasting. When we provide guidance for adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide guidance on an effective tax rate basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses. \\n 55 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Company Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Cash Provided By/(Used In) Operating Activities) Measure of Company s operating cash flow excluding Ford Credit s operating cash flows. The measure contains elements management considers operating activities, including Company excluding Ford Credit capital spending, Ford Credit distributions to its parent, and settlement of derivatives. The measure excludes cash outflows for funded pension contributions, restructuring actions, and other items that are considered operating cash flows under U.S. GAAP. This measure is useful to management and investors because it is consistent with management s assessment of the Company s operating cash flow performance. When we provide guidance for Company adjusted free cash flow, we do not provide guidance for net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities because the GAAP measure will include items that are difficult to quantify or predict with reasonable certainty, including cash flows related to the Company's exposures to foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices (separate from any related hedges), Ford Credit's operating cash flows, and cash flows related to special items, including separation payments, each of which individually or in the aggregate could have a significant impact to our net cash provided by/(used in) our operating activities. \\n \\n Adjusted ROIC Calculated as the sum of adjusted net operating profit/(loss) after cash tax from the last four quarters, divided by the average invested capital over the last four quarters. Adjusted Return on Invested Capital Adjusted ROIC provides management and investors with useful information to evaluate the Company s after-cash tax operating return on its invested capital for the period presented. Adjusted net operating profit/(loss) after cash tax measures operating results less special items, interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), and certain pension/OPEB costs. Average invested capital is the sum of average balance sheet equity, debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), and net pension/OPEB liability. \\n 56 \\n\\nItem 2.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \\n\\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS \\n \\n Electric Vehicle Market \\n \\n Although we continue to invest in our electric vehicle strategy, we have observed lower-than-anticipated industrywide electric vehicle adoption rates and near-term pricing pressures, which has led us, and may in the future lead us, to adjust our spending, production, and/or product launches to better match the pace of electric vehicle adoption. As a result, we have incurred, and may continue to incur, expenses related to payments to our electric vehicle-related suppliers (battery, raw material, or otherwise), inventory adjustments, or other matters. Further, significant unexpected changes in the EV demand environment have led, and may in the future lead, to incremental competitive pricing actions. These market dynamics may continue to occur, which could have a substantial impact on our business. \\n \\n As a result, in the first quarter of 2024, we recorded about 0.4 billion of expenses and about 0.3 billion of adjustments related to revenue recognized in prior periods. In addition, slower-than-anticipated development of the electric vehicle market may impact our strategy to comply with regulatory standards, and, in some cases, we plan to utilize credits purchased from third parties to demonstrate regulatory compliance or we may need to modify our product offerings. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K Report and as updated by our subsequent filings with the SEC for a discussion of the risks related to lower-than-anticipated electric vehicle volumes and our planned transition to a greater mix of electric vehicles. \\n\\n34 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \\n \\n In the first quarter of 2024, the net income attributable to Ford Motor Company was 1,332 million, and Company adjusted EBIT was 2,763 million. \\n \\n Net income/(loss) includes certain items special items that are excluded from Company adjusted EBIT. These items are discussed in more detail in Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. We report special items separately to allow investors analyzing our results to identify certain infrequent significant items that they may wish to exclude when considering the trend of ongoing operating results. Our pre-tax and tax special items were as follows (in millions): \\n First Quarter 2023 2024 Restructuring (by Geography) Europe (370) (321) China (309) North America Hourly Buyouts (260) Other 12 Subtotal Restructuring (667) (581) Other Items Extended Oakville EV Program Changeover \\n (291) Other (including gains/(losses) on investments) (86) 2 Subtotal Other Items (86) (289) Pension and OPEB Gain/(Loss) Pension and OPEB remeasurement (113) 11 Pension settlements and curtailments (46) (14) Subtotal Pension and OPEB Gain/(Loss) (159) (3) Total EBIT Special Items (912) (873) Provision for/(Benefit from) tax special items (a) (144) (220) \\n __________ \\n (a) Includes related tax effect on special items and tax special items. \\n \\n We recorded 873 million of pre-tax special item charges in the first quarter of 2024, driven primarily by restructuring actions in Europe, the extended duration of the EV program changeover at Oakville, and buyouts for hourly employees in North America. \\n \\n In Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, special items are reflected as a separate reconciling item, as opposed to being allocated among our segments. This reflects the fact that management excludes these items from its review of operating segment results for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources. \\n 35 \\n\\nItem 2.

First quarter 2024 revenue decreased 13 , driven by lower wholesales and unfavorable mix, offset partially by higher currency-related pricing in South America. \\n \\n Ford Blue s first quarter 2024 EBIT was 905 million, a decrease of 1.7 billion from a year ago, with an EBIT margin of 4.2 . The lower EBIT was driven by lower wholesales and unfavorable mix (primarily fewer F-150s due to the new model launch). Higher costs reflected primarily material cost for new products and higher warranty costs, offset partially by lower structural costs. \\n \\n 37 \\n\\nItem 2.

First quarter 2024 revenue decreased 84 , primarily driven by the accrual impacts for units in dealer stock at December 31, 2023 (about 0.3 billion) as well as lower net pricing. \\n \\n Ford Model e s first quarter 2024 EBIT loss was 1.3 billion, a 598 million higher loss than a year ago. The lower EBIT was primarily driven by lower net pricing and exchange. Favorable cost performance included lower battery raw materials and engineering expense, offset partially by volume-related obligations of about 90 million for batteries and certain other commodities and higher manufacturing costs ahead of the upcoming Explorer EV launch in Europe. \\n\\nFord Pro Segment \\n First Quarter Key Metrics 2023 2024 H / (L) Wholesale Units (000) (a) 337 409 71 Revenue M) 13,249 18,019 4,770 EBIT M) 1,366 3,008 1,642 EBIT Margin ) 10.3 16.7 6.4 ppts \\n __________ \\n (a) Includes Ford brand vehicles produced and sold by our unconsolidated affiliate Ford Otosan in T rkiye (about 22,000 units in Q1 2023 and 18,000 units in Q1 2024). \\n \\n Change in EBIT by Causal Factor (in millions) First Quarter 2023 EBIT \\n 1,366 Volume / Mix 1,795 Net Pricing 680 Cost (1,054) Exchange 159 Other 62 First Quarter 2024 EBIT \\n 3,008 \\n \\n In the first quarter of 2024, Ford Pro s wholesales increased 21 from a year ago, driven by a full quarter of the all new Super Duty truck, which launched in the first quarter of 2023, and higher sales of the Transit range of vans. First quarter 2024 revenue increased 36 , driven by higher wholesales, favorable mix, and higher net pricing. \\n \\n Ford Pro s first quarter 2024 EBIT was 3.0 billion, an increase of 1.6 billion from a year ago, with an EBIT margin of 16.7 . The improvement in EBIT was driven by higher volume, favorable mix, and higher net pricing. Higher cost was a partial offset, including material costs (primarily new product-related and inflationary increases), higher growth-related structural costs (including engineering and manufacturing), and higher warranty costs. \\n 38 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Definitions and Information Regarding Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro Causal Factors \\n \\n In general, we measure year-over-year change in Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro segment EBIT using the causal factors listed below, with net pricing and cost variances calculated at present-period volume and mix and exchange: \\n \\n Market Factors (exclude the impact of unconsolidated affiliate wholesale units): \\n Volume and Mix primarily measures EBIT variance from changes in wholesale unit volumes (at prior-year average contribution margin per unit) driven by changes in industry volume, market share, and dealer stocks, as well as the EBIT variance resulting from changes in product mix, including mix among vehicle lines and mix of trim levels and options within a vehicle line \\n Net Pricing primarily measures EBIT variance driven by changes in wholesale unit prices to dealers and marketing incentive programs such as rebate programs, low-rate financing offers, special lease offers, and stock adjustments on dealer inventory \\n \\n Cost: \\n Contribution Costs primarily measures EBIT variance driven by per-unit changes in cost categories that typically vary with volume, such as material costs (including commodity and component costs), warranty expense, and freight and duty costs \\n Structural Costs primarily measures EBIT variance driven by absolute change in cost categories that typically do not have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume. Structural costs include the following cost categories: \\n Manufacturing, Including Volume-Related consists primarily of costs for hourly and salaried manufacturing personnel, plant overhead (such as utilities and taxes), and new product launch expense. These costs could be affected by volume for operating pattern actions such as overtime, line-speed, and shift schedules \\n Engineering and Connectivity consists primarily of costs for vehicle and software engineering personnel, prototype materials, testing, and outside engineering and software services \\n Spending-Related consists primarily of depreciation and amortization of our manufacturing and engineering assets, but also includes asset retirements and operating leases \\n Advertising and Sales Promotions includes costs for advertising, marketing programs, brand promotions, customer mailings and promotional events, and auto shows \\n Administrative, Information Technology, and Selling includes primarily costs for salaried personnel and purchased services related to our staff activities, information technology, and selling functions \\n \\n Exchange primarily measures EBIT variance driven by one or more of the following: (i) transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the relevant entities, (ii) effects of converting functional currency income to U.S. dollars, (iii) effects of remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities of the relevant entities in currencies other than their functional currency, or (iv) results of our foreign currency hedging \\n \\n Other includes a variety of items, such as parts and services earnings, royalties, government incentives, and compensation-related changes \\n \\n In addition, definitions and calculations used in this report include: \\n \\n Wholesales and Revenue wholesale unit volumes include all Ford and Lincoln badged units (whether produced by Ford or by an unconsolidated affiliate) that are sold to dealerships or others, units manufactured by Ford that are sold to other manufacturers, units distributed by Ford for other manufacturers, and local brand units produced by our China joint venture, Jiangling Motors Corporation, Ltd. JMC ), that are sold to dealerships or others. Vehicles sold to daily rental car companies that are subject to a guaranteed repurchase option (i.e., rental repurchase), as well as other sales of finished vehicles for which the recognition of revenue is deferred (e.g., consignments), also are included in wholesale unit volumes. Revenue from certain vehicles in wholesale unit volumes (specifically, Ford badged vehicles produced and distributed by our unconsolidated affiliates, as well as JMC brand vehicles) are not included in our revenue. Excludes transactions between Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro segments \\n \\n Industry Volume and Market Share based, in part, on estimated vehicle registrations; includes medium and heavy duty trucks \\n \\n SAAR seasonally adjusted annual rate \\n 39 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Ford Next Segment \\n \\n The Ford Next segment primarily includes expenses and investments for emerging business initiatives aimed at creating value for Ford in vehicle-adjacent market segments. Ford Next s first quarter 2024 EBIT loss was 9 million, a 35 million improvement from a year ago. \\n\\nFord Credit Segment \\n \\n Ford Credit files periodic reports with the SEC that contain additional information regarding Ford Credit. The reports are available through Ford Credit s website located at www.ford.com/finance/investor-center and can also be found on the SEC s website located at www.sec.gov .

The first quarter 2024 U.S. loss-to-receivables LTR ratio of 47 basis points increased from a year ago, but remained low by historical standards. U.S. auction values in the first quarter of 2024 were lower compared to a year ago. \\n \\n Ford Credit s first quarter 2024 EBT of 326 million was 23 million higher than a year ago, explained primarily by higher financing margin and favorable volume and mix, offset partially by unfavorable lease residual performance. \\n 40 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Definitions and Information Regarding Ford Credit Causal Factors \\n \\n In general, we measure year-over-year changes in Ford Credit s EBT using the causal factors listed below: \\n \\n Volume and Mix: \\n Volume primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by changes in average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses at prior period financing margin yield (defined below in financing margin) at prior period exchange rates. Volume changes are primarily driven by the volume of new and used vehicles sold and leased, the extent to which Ford Credit purchases retail financing and operating lease contracts, the extent to which Ford Credit provides wholesale financing, the sales price of the vehicles financed, the level of dealer inventories, Ford-sponsored special financing programs available exclusively through Ford Credit, and the availability of cost-effective funding \\n Mix primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by period-over-period changes in the composition of Ford Credit s average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses by product within each region \\n \\n Financing Margin: \\n Financing margin variance is the period-over-period change in financing margin yield multiplied by the present period average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses at prior period exchange rates. This calculation is performed at the product and country level and then aggregated. Financing margin yield equals revenue, less interest expense and scheduled depreciation for the period, divided by average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses for the same period \\n Financing margin changes are driven by changes in revenue and interest expense. Changes in revenue are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, cost assumptions in pricing, mix of business, and competitive environment. Changes in interest expense are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, borrowing spreads, and asset-liability management \\n \\n Credit Loss: \\n Credit loss is the change in the provision for credit losses at prior period exchange rates. For analysis purposes, management splits the provision for credit losses into net charge-offs and the change in the allowance for credit losses \\n Net charge-off changes are primarily driven by the number of repossessions, severity per repossession, and recoveries. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are primarily driven by changes in historical trends in credit losses and recoveries, changes in the composition and size of Ford Credit s present portfolio, changes in trends in historical used vehicle values, and changes in forward looking macroeconomic conditions. For additional information, refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates - Allowance for Credit Losses section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2023 Form 10-K Report \\n \\n Lease Residual: \\n Lease residual measures changes to residual performance at prior period exchange rates. For analysis purposes, management splits residual performance primarily into residual gains and losses, and the change in accumulated supplemental depreciation \\n Residual gain and loss changes are primarily driven by the number of vehicles returned to Ford Credit and sold, and the difference between the auction value and the depreciated value (which includes both base and accumulated supplemental depreciation) of the vehicles sold. Changes in accumulated supplemental depreciation are primarily driven by changes in Ford Credit s estimate of the expected auction value at the end of the lease term and changes in Ford Credit s estimate of the number of vehicles that will be returned to it and sold. Depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases includes early termination losses on operating leases due to customer default events. For additional information, refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates - Accumulated Depreciation on Vehicles Subject to Operating Leases section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2023 Form 10-K Report \\n \\n Exchange: \\n Reflects changes in EBT driven by the effects of converting functional currency income to U.S. dollars \\n \\n Other: \\n Primarily includes operating expenses, other revenue, insurance expenses, and other income/(loss) at prior period exchange rates \\n Changes in operating expenses are primarily driven by salaried personnel costs, facilities costs, and costs associated with the origination and servicing of customer contracts \\n In general, other income/(loss) changes are primarily driven by changes in earnings related to market valuation adjustments to derivatives (primarily related to movements in interest rates) and other miscellaneous items \\n 41 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n In addition, the following definitions and calculations apply to Ford Credit when used in this Report: \\n \\n Cash (as shown in the Funding Structure and Liquidity tables) Cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash, excluding amounts related to insurance activities \\n \\n Debt (as shown in the Key Metrics and Leverage tables) Debt on Ford Credit s balance sheets. Includes debt issued in securitizations and payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets and related enhancements. Ford Credit holds the right to receive the excess cash flows not needed to pay the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions \\n \\n Earnings Before Taxes EBT Reflects Ford Credit s income before income taxes \\n \\n Loss-to-Receivables LTR Ratio LTR ratio is calculated using net charge-offs divided by average finance receivables, excluding unearned interest supplements and the allowance for credit losses \\n \\n Return on Equity ROE (as shown in the Key Metrics table) Reflects return on equity calculated by annualizing net income for the period and dividing by monthly average equity for the period \\n \\n Securitization and Restricted Cash (as shown in the Liquidity table) Securitization cash is held for the benefit of the securitization investors (for example, a reserve fund). Restricted cash primarily includes cash held to meet certain local governmental and regulatory reserve requirements and cash held under the terms of certain contractual agreements \\n \\n Securitizations (as shown in the Public Term Funding Plan table) Public securitization transactions, Rule 144A offerings sponsored by Ford Credit, and widely distributed offerings by Ford Credit Canada \\n \\n Term Asset-Backed Securities ABS (as shown in the Funding Structure table) Obligations issued in securitization transactions that are payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets and related enhancements \\n \\n Total Net Receivables (as shown in the Key Metrics table) Includes finance receivables (retail financing and wholesale) sold for legal purposes and net investment in operating leases included in securitization transactions that do not satisfy the requirements for accounting sale treatment. These receivables and operating leases are reported on Ford Credit s balance sheets and are available only for payment of the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions; they are not available to pay the other obligations of Ford Credit or the claims of Ford Credit s other creditors \\n\\n42 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Corporate Other \\n \\n Corporate Other primarily includes corporate governance expenses, past service pension and OPEB income and expense, interest income (excluding Ford Credit interest income and interest earned on our extended service contract portfolio) and gains and losses from our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding gains and losses on investments in equity securities), and foreign exchange derivatives gains and losses associated with intercompany lending. Corporate governance expenses are primarily administrative, delivering benefit on behalf of the global enterprise, that are not allocated to operating segments. These include expenses related to setting and directing global policy, providing oversight and stewardship, and promoting the Company s interests. In the first quarter of 2024, Corporate Other had a 147 million EBIT loss, unchanged from a year ago. \\n\\nInterest on Debt \\n \\n Interest on Debt, which consists of interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit, was 278 million in the first quarter of 2024, 30 million lower than a year ago. \\n\\nTaxes \\n \\n Our Provision for/(Benefit from) income taxes for the first quarter of 2024 was a provision of 278 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 17.2 . \\n \\n Our first quarter 2024 adjusted effective tax rate, which excludes special items, was 20.0 . \\n \\n We regularly review our organizational structure and income tax elections for affiliates in non-U.S. and U.S. tax jurisdictions, which may result in changes in affiliates that are included in or excluded from our U.S. tax return. Any future changes to our structure, as well as any changes in income tax laws in the countries that we operate, could cause increases or decreases to our deferred tax balances and related valuation allowances. \\n 43 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \\n \\n At March 31, 2024, total balance sheet cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash, including Ford Credit and entities held for sale, was 34.7 billion. \\n \\n We consider our key balance sheet metrics to be: (i) Company cash, which includes cash equivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash, including cash held for sale, excluding Ford Credit s cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash; and (ii) Company liquidity, which includes Company cash, less restricted cash, and total available committed credit lines, excluding Ford Credit s total available committed credit lines. \\n \\n Company excluding Ford Credit \\n December 31, 2023 March 31, 2024 Balance Sheets B) \\n Company Cash 28.8 25.1 Liquidity 46.4 42.6 Debt (19.9) (20.2) Cash Net of Debt 8.9 4.9 Pension Funded Status B) (a) \\n Funded Plans 2.1 2.6 Unfunded Plans (4.4) (4.3) Total Global Pension (2.3) (1.7) Total Funded Status OPEB (4.7) (4.6) \\n __________ \\n (a) Balances at March 31, 2024 reflect net funded status at December 31, 2023, updated for service and interest cost; expected return on assets; curtailments, settlements, and associated interim remeasurement (where applicable); separation expense; actual benefit payments; and cash contributions. The discount rate and rate of expected return assumptions are unchanged from year-end 2023. \\n \\n Liquidity . Our key priority is to maintain a strong balance sheet to withstand potential stress scenarios, while having resources available to invest in and grow our business. At March 31, 2024, we had Company cash of 25.1 billion and liquidity of 42.6 billion. At March 31, 2024, about 86 of Company cash was held by consolidated entities domiciled in the United States. \\n \\n To be prepared for an economic downturn and other stress scenarios, we target an ongoing Company cash balance at or above 20 billion plus significant additional liquidity above our Company cash target. We expect to have periods when we will be above or below this amount due to: (i) future cash flow expectations, such as for investments in future opportunities, capital investments, debt maturities, pension contributions, or restructuring requirements, (ii) short-term timing differences, and (iii) changes in the global economic or operating environment. \\n \\n Our Company cash investments primarily include U.S. Department of Treasury obligations, federal agency securities, bank time deposits with investment-grade institutions, investment-grade corporate securities, investment-grade commercial paper, and debt obligations of a select group of non-U.S. governments, non-U.S. governmental agencies, and supranational institutions. The average maturity of these investments is approximately one year and adjusted based on market conditions and liquidity needs. We monitor our Company cash levels and average maturity on a daily basis. \\n 44 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Material Cash Requirements. Our material cash requirements include: \\n \\n Capital expenditures (for additional information, see the Changes in Company Cash section below) and other payments for engineering, software, product development, and implementation of our plans for electric vehicles \\n \\n Purchase of raw materials and components to support the manufacturing and sale of vehicles (including electric vehicles), parts, and accessories (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table and the accompanying description of our Purchase obligations in the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Company Excluding Ford Credit section in Item 7 of our 2023 Form 10-K Report) \\n \\n Marketing incentive payments to dealers \\n \\n Payments for warranty and field service actions (for additional information, see Note 18 of the Notes to the Financial Statements herein) \\n \\n Debt repayments (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table in the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Company Excluding Ford Credit section in Item 7 and Note 19 of the Notes the Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K Report) \\n \\n Discretionary and mandatory payments to our global pension plans (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table in the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Company Excluding Ford Credit section in Item 7 of our 2023 Form 10-K Report, the Changes in Company Cash section below, and Note 11 of the Notes to the Financial Statements herein) \\n \\n Employee wages, benefits, and incentives \\n \\n Operating lease payments (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table in the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Company Excluding Ford Credit section in Item 7 and Note 18 of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K Report) \\n \\n Cash effects related to the restructuring of our business \\n \\n Strategic acquisitions and investments to grow our business, including electrification \\n \\n Subject to approval by our Board of Directors, shareholder distributions in the form of dividend payments and/or a share repurchase program (including share repurchases to offset the anti-dilutive effect of increased share-based compensation) may require the expenditure of a material amount of cash. We target shareholder distributions of 40 to 50 of adjusted free cash flow. Moreover, we may be subject to additional material cash requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, e.g., legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions, and other matters. \\n \\n We plan to utilize our liquidity (as described above) and our cash flows from business operations to fund our material cash requirements. \\n\\n45 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Changes in Company Cash. In managing our business, we classify changes in Company cash into operating and non-operating items. Operating items include: Company adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit EBT, capital spending, depreciation and tooling amortization, changes in working capital, Ford Credit distributions, interest on debt, cash taxes, and all other and timing differences (including timing differences between accrual-based EBIT and associated cash flows). Non-operating items include: restructuring costs, changes in Company debt excluding Ford Credit, contributions to funded pension plans, shareholder distributions, and other items (including gains and losses on investments in equity securities, acquisitions and divestitures, equity investments, and other transactions with Ford Credit). \\n \\n With respect to Changes in working capital, in general, the Company excluding Ford Credit carries relatively low trade receivables compared with our trade payables because the majority of our wholesales are financed (primarily by Ford Credit) immediately upon the sale of vehicles to dealers, which generally occurs shortly after being produced. In contrast, our trade payables are based primarily on industry-standard production supplier payment terms of about 45 days. As a result, our cash flow deteriorates if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) decrease while trade payables continue to become due. Conversely, our cash flow improves if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) increase while new trade payables are generally not due for about 45 days. For example, the suspension of production at most of our assembly plants and lower industry volumes due to COVID-19 in early 2020 resulted in an initial deterioration of our cash flow, while the subsequent resumption of manufacturing operations and return to pre-COVID-19 production levels at most of our assembly plants resulted in a subsequent improvement of our cash flow. Even in normal economic conditions, however, these working capital balances generally are subject to seasonal changes that can impact cash flow. For example, we typically experience cash flow timing differences associated with inventories and payables due to our annual shutdown periods when production, and therefore inventories and wholesale volumes, are usually at their lowest levels, while payables continue to come due and be paid. The net impact of this typically results in cash outflows from changes in our working capital balances during these shutdown periods. \\n \\n Our finished product inventory at March 31, 2024 was higher than at December 31, 2023, primarily reflecting new vehicle launches and units awaiting final quality review. \\n \\n In response to, or in anticipation of, supplier disruptions, we may stockpile certain components or raw materials to help prevent disruption in our production of vehicles. Such actions could have a short-term adverse impact on our cash and increase our inventory. Moreover, in order to secure critical materials for production of electric vehicles, we have entered into and we may, in the future, enter into offtake agreements with raw material suppliers and make investments in certain raw material and battery suppliers, including contributing up to a maximum of 6.6 billion in capital to BlueOval SK, LLC over a five-year period ending in 2026. Our actual capital outlay could vary significantly based on the final project costs and potential financing opportunities. Such investments could have an additional adverse impact on our cash in the near-term. \\n \\n The terms of the offtake agreements we have entered into, and those we may enter into in the future, vary by transaction, though they generally obligate us to purchase a certain percentage or minimum amount of output produced by the counterparty over an agreed upon period of time. The purchase price mechanism included in the offtake agreement is typically based on the market price of the material at the time of delivery. The terms may also include conditions to our obligation to purchase the materials, such as quality or minimum output. Subject to satisfaction of those conditions, we will be obligated to purchase the materials at the cost determined by the purchase price mechanism. As of March 31, 2024, our estimated expenditures for the maximum quantity that we are committed to purchase under these offtake agreements through 2035, subject to certain conditions, consist of approximately 3.9 billion of purchase obligations and approximately 6.9 billion of contingent purchase obligations based on our present forecast; however, our forecast could fluctuate from period to period based on market prices, which could result in significant increases or decreases in our estimate. The actual price paid for these materials will be recorded on our balance sheet at the time of purchase. In addition, as market conditions dictate, we may enter into additional offtake agreements with raw material suppliers or seek to renegotiate existing agreements. Based on the offtake agreements we have entered into thus far, the earliest date by which we could be obligated to purchase any output, subject to satisfaction of the applicable conditions, will be in the second half of 2024. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K Report and as updated by our subsequent filings with the SEC for a discussion of the risks related to our offtake agreements and other long-term purchase contracts. \\n\\n46 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Financial institutions participate in a supply chain finance SCF program that enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their Ford receivables (i.e., our payment obligations to the suppliers) to the financial institutions on a non-recourse basis in order to be paid earlier than our payment terms provide. Our suppliers voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms, the amounts we pay, or our liquidity. We have no economic interest in a supplier s decision to participate in the SCF program, and we do not provide any guarantees in connection with it. As of March 31, 2024, the outstanding amount of Ford receivables that suppliers elected to sell to the SCF financial institutions was 213 million. The amount settled through the SCF program during the first quarter of 2024 was 383 million. \\n \\n Changes in Company cash excluding Ford Credit are summarized below (in billions): \\n First Quarter 2023 2024 Company Excluding Ford Credit Company Adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit (a) 3.1 2.4 Capital spending (1.8) (2.1) Depreciation and tooling amortization 1.3 1.3 Net spending (0.5) (0.8) Receivables 0.4 Inventory (2.0) (3.1) Trade Payables 0.3 1.9 Changes in working capital (1.2) (1.2) Ford Credit distributions Interest on debt and cash taxes (0.6) (0.7) All other and timing differences (0.1) (0.2) Company adjusted free cash flow (a) 0.7 (0.5) Restructuring (0.2) Changes in debt (0.2) 0.2 Funded pension contributions (0.1) (0.5) Shareholder distributions (3.2) (1.3) All other (0.7) (1.4) Change in cash (3.6) (3.8) \\n __________ \\n (a) See Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations section for reconciliation to GAAP. \\n Note: Numbers may not sum due to rounding. \\n \\n Our first quarter 2024 Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities was positive 1.4 billion, 1.4 billion lower than a year ago (see page 60 for additional information). The decrease reflects higher inventory and lower net income, offset partially by higher accounts payable as reflected on our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Company adjusted free cash flow was negative 0.5 billion, 1.2 billion lower than a year ago. The decrease was primarily driven by lower Company adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit and higher capital spending. \\n \\n Capital spending was 2.1 billion in the first quarter of 2024, an increase of 0.3 billion from a year ago. We now expect full year 2024 capital spending to be in the range of 8 billion to 9 billion. \\n \\n First quarter 2024 working capital impact was 1.2 billion negative, driven by higher inventory, offset partially by higher trade payables, each compared to December 31, 2023. All other and timing differences were negative 0.2 billion. Timing differences include differences between accrual-based EBIT and the associated cash flows (e.g., marketing incentive and warranty payments to dealers, JV equity income, compensation payments, and pension and OPEB income or expense). \\n \\n In the first quarter of 2024, we contributed 550 million to our global funded pension plans. We continue to expect to contribute about 1 billion to our global funded pension plans in 2024. \\n \\n Shareholder distributions were 1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2024, all of which was attributable to our regular and supplemental dividend. \\n 47 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Available Credit Lines . Total Company committed credit lines, excluding Ford Credit, at March 31, 2024 were 19.4 billion, consisting of 13.5 billion of our corporate credit facility, 2.0 billion of our supplemental revolving credit facility, 1.8 billion of our 364-day revolving credit facility, and 2.2 billion of local credit facilities. At March 31, 2024, the utilized portion of the corporate credit facility was 18 million, representing amounts utilized for letters of credit. In addition, 1.7 billion of committed Company credit lines, excluding Ford Credit, was utilized under local credit facilities for our affiliates as of March 31, 2024. \\n \\n Our corporate, supplemental, and 364-day revolving credit facilities were amended as of April 22, 2024 to extend the maturity dates of the commitments under each facility and increase the size of our 364-day revolving credit facility. Following the corporate credit facility amendment, 25 million of commitments mature on April 26, 2026, 3.4 billion of commitments mature on April 22, 2027, 0.1 billion of commitments mature on April 26, 2028, and 10.0 billion of commitments mature on April 20, 2029. Following the supplemental revolving credit facility amendment, 2.0 billion of commitments mature on April 22, 2027. Following the 364-day revolving credit facility amendment, 2.5 billion of commitments mature on April 21, 2025. \\n \\n The corporate, supplemental, and 364-day credit agreements include certain sustainability-linked targets, pursuant to which the applicable margin and facility fees may be adjusted if Ford achieves, or fails to achieve, the specified targets related to global manufacturing facility greenhouse gas emissions, carbon-free electricity consumption, and Ford Europe CO 2 tailpipe emissions. \\n \\n The corporate credit facility is unsecured and free of material adverse change conditions to borrowing, restrictive financial covenants (for example, interest or fixed-charge coverage ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and minimum net worth requirements), and credit rating triggers that could limit our ability to obtain funding or trigger early repayment. The corporate credit facility contains a liquidity covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum of 4 billion in aggregate of domestic cash, cash equivalents, and loaned and marketable securities and/or availability under the corporate credit facility, supplemental revolving credit facility, and 364-day revolving credit facility. If our senior, unsecured, long-term debt does not maintain at least two investment grade ratings from Fitch, Moody s, and S P, the guarantees of certain subsidiaries will be required. The terms and conditions of the supplemental and 364-day revolving credit facilities are consistent with our corporate credit facility. Ford Credit has been designated as a subsidiary borrower under the corporate credit facility and the 364-day revolving credit facility. \\n \\n Debt. As shown in Note 12 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, at March 31, 2024, Company debt excluding Ford Credit was 20.2 billion. This balance is 0.2 billion higher than at December 31, 2023. \\n \\n Leverage. We manage Company debt (excluding Ford Credit) levels with a leverage framework that targets investment grade credit ratings through a normal business cycle. The leverage framework includes a ratio of total Company debt (excluding Ford Credit), underfunded pension liabilities, operating leases, and other adjustments, divided by Company adjusted EBIT (excluding Ford Credit EBT), and further adjusted to exclude depreciation and tooling amortization (excluding Ford Credit). \\n \\n Ford Credit s leverage is calculated as a separate business as described in the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Ford Credit Segment section of Item 2. Ford Credit is self-funding and its debt, which is used to fund its operations, is separate from our Company debt excluding Ford Credit. \\n 48 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Ford Credit Segment \\n \\n Ford Credit remains well capitalized with a strong balance sheet and funding diversified across platforms and markets. Ford Credit ended the first quarter of 2024 with 27.0 billion of liquidity, up 1.3 billion from year-end. Ford Credit continues to have robust access to capital markets, completing 13 billion of public term issuances through April 23, 2024. \\n \\n Key elements of Ford Credit s funding strategy include: \\n \\n Maintain strong liquidity and funding diversity \\n Prudently access public markets \\n Continue to leverage retail deposit funding in Europe \\n Flexibility to increase ABS mix as needed; preserving assets and committed capacity \\n Target financial statement leverage of 9:1 to 10:1 \\n Maintain self-liquidating balance sheet \\n \\n Ford Credit s liquidity profile continues to be diverse, robust, and focused on maintaining liquidity levels that meet its business and funding requirements. Ford Credit regularly stress tests its balance sheet and liquidity to ensure that it can continue to meet its financial obligations through economic cycles. \\n \\n The following table shows funding for Ford Credit s net receivables (in billions): \\n March 31, 2023 December 31, 2023 March 31, 2024 Funding Structure Term unsecured debt 49.3 54.1 57.0 Term asset-backed securities 55.0 58.0 54.9 Retail Deposits / Ford Interest Advantage 15.3 17.2 17.4 Other 2.3 1.4 1.6 Equity 12.2 13.4 13.5 Adjustments for cash (10.3) (10.9) (8.9) Total Net Receivables 123.8 133.2 135.5 Securitized Funding as Percent of Total Debt 46.0 44.9 42.5 \\n \\n Net receivables of 135.5 billion at March 31, 2024 were funded primarily with term unsecured debt and term asset-backed securities. Securitized funding as a percent of total debt was 42.5 as of March 31, 2024. \\n \\n Public Term Funding Plan. The following table shows Ford Credit s issuances for full year 2022 and 2023, planned issuances for full year 2024, and its global public term funding issuances through April 23, 2024, excluding short-term funding programs (in billions): \\n 2022 Actual 2023 Actual 2024 Forecast Through April 23 Unsecured 6 14 14-17 8 Securitizations (a) 10 14 13-16 5 Total public 16 28 27-33 13 \\n __________ \\n (a) See Definitions and Information Regarding Ford Credit Causal Factors section. \\n \\n For 2024, Ford Credit continues to project full year public term funding in the range of 27 billion to 33 billion. \\n 49 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Liquidity. The following table shows Ford Credit s liquidity sources and utilization (in billions): \\n March 31, 2023 December 31, 2023 March 31, 2024 Liquidity Sources (a) \\n Cash 10.3 10.9 8.9 Committed asset-backed facilities 40.5 42.9 42.6 Other unsecured credit facilities 2.5 2.4 2.3 Total liquidity sources 53.3 56.2 53.8 Utilization of Liquidity (a) \\n Securitization and restricted cash (3.0) (2.8) (3.4) Committed asset-backed facilities (24.0) (27.5) (23.3) Other unsecured credit facilities (0.4) (0.4) (0.4) Total utilization of liquidity (27.4) (30.7) (27.1) Available Liquidity 25.9 25.5 26.7 Other adjustments 0.2 0.2 0.3 Net liquidity available for use 26.1 25.7 27.0 \\n __________ \\n (a) See Definitions and Information Regarding Ford Credit Causal Factors section. \\n \\n Ford Credit s net liquidity available for use will fluctuate quarterly based on factors including near-term debt maturities, receivable growth and decline, and timing of funding transactions. At March 31, 2024, Ford Credit s net liquidity available for use was 27.0 billion, 1.3 billion higher than year-end 2023, reflecting strong access to public funding markets. At March 31, 2024, Ford Credit s liquidity sources, including cash, committed asset-backed facilities, and unsecured credit facilities, totaled 53.8 billion, down 2.4 billion from year-end 2023. \\n \\n Material Cash Requirements. Ford Credit s material cash requirements include: (1) the purchase of retail financing and operating lease contracts from dealers and providing wholesale financing for dealers to finance new and used vehicles; and (2) debt repayments (for additional information on debt, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table in the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Company Excluding Ford Credit section in Item 7 and Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K Report). In addition, subject to approval by Ford Credit s Board of Directors, shareholder distributions may require the expenditure of a material amount of cash. Moreover, Ford Credit may be subject to additional material cash requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, e.g., legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions, and other matters. \\n \\n Ford Credit plans to utilize its liquidity (as described above) and its cash flows from business operations to fund its material cash requirements. \\n \\n Funding and Liquidity Risks. Ford Credit s funding plan is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control, including disruption in the capital markets, that could impact both unsecured debt and asset-backed securities issuance and the effects of regulatory changes on the financial markets. Refer to the Liquidity - Ford Credit Segment - Funding and Liquidity Risks section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2023 Form 10-K Report for more information. \\n \\n 50 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Leverage. Ford Credit uses leverage, or the debt-to-equity ratio, to make various business decisions, including evaluating and establishing pricing for finance receivable and operating lease financing, and assessing its capital structure. \\n \\n The table below shows the calculation of Ford Credit s financial statement leverage (in billions): \\n March 31, 2023 December 31, 2023 March 31, 2024 Leverage Calculation Debt 119.6 129.3 129.3 Equity (a) 12.2 13.4 13.5 Financial statement leverage (to 1) 9.8 9.7 9.6 \\n __________ \\n (a) Total shareholder s interest reported on Ford Credit s balance sheets. \\n \\n Ford Credit plans its leverage by considering market conditions and the risk characteristics of its business. At March 31, 2024, Ford Credit s financial statement leverage was 9.6:1. Ford Credit targets financial statement leverage in the range of 9:1 to 10:1. \\n \\n 51 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Total Company \\n \\n Pension Plans - Funded Balances. As of March 31, 2024, our total Company pension underfunded status reported on our consolidated balance sheets was 1.7 billion and reflects the net funded status at December 31, 2023, updated for: service and interest cost; expected return on assets; curtailments, settlements, and associated interim remeasurement (where applicable); separation expense; actual benefit payments; and cash contributions. For plans without interim remeasurement, the discount rate and rate of expected return assumptions are unchanged from year-end 2023. \\n \\n Return on Invested Capital ROIC ). We analyze total Company performance using an adjusted ROIC financial metric based on an after-tax, rolling four-quarter average. The following table contains the calculation of our ROIC for the periods shown (in billions): \\n Four Quarters Ending March 31, 2023 March 31, 2024 Adjusted Net Operating Profit/(Loss) After Cash Tax Net income/(loss) attributable to Ford 2.9 3.9 Add: Noncontrolling interest (0.3) 0.1 Less: Income tax (0.4) 0.6 Add: Cash tax (0.9) (1.2) Less: Interest on debt (1.3) (1.3) Less: Total pension/OPEB income/(cost) (0.1) (2.9) Add: Pension/OPEB service costs (0.9) (0.6) Net operating profit/(loss) after cash tax 2.6 5.8 Less: Special items (excl. pension/OPEB) pre-tax (6.6) (2.9) Adjusted net operating profit/(loss) after cash tax 9.2 8.7 Invested Capital Equity 42.2 42.9 Debt (excl.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n CREDIT RATINGS \\n \\n Our short-term and long-term debt is rated by four credit rating agencies designated as nationally recognized statistical rating organizations NRSROs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission: DBRS, Fitch, Moody s, and S P. \\n \\n In several markets, locally recognized rating agencies also rate us. A credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the credit risk associated with a corporate entity or particular securities issued by that entity. Rating agencies ratings of us are based on information provided by us and other sources. Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria for evaluating company risk and, therefore, ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. \\n \\n There have been no rating actions taken by these NRSROs since the filing of our 2023 Form 10-K Report. \\n \\n The following table summarizes certain of the credit ratings and outlook presently assigned by these four NRSROs: \\n NRSRO RATINGS Ford Ford Credit NRSROs Issuer Default / Corporate / Issuer Rating Long-Term Senior Unsecured Outlook / Trend Long-Term Senior Unsecured Short-Term Unsecured Outlook / Trend Minimum Long-Term Investment Grade Rating DBRS BBB (low) BBB (low) Stable BBB (low) R-2 (low) Stable BBB (low) Fitch BBB- BBB- Stable BBB- F3 Stable BBB- Moody s N/A Ba1 Stable Ba1 NP Stable Baa3 S P BBB- BBB- Stable BBB- A-3 Stable BBB- \\n \\n 53 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n OUTLOOK \\n \\n We provided 2024 Company guidance in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K dated April 24, 2024. The guidance is based on our expectations as of April 24, 2024, and assumes no material change to our current assumptions for inflation, logistics issues, production, or macroeconomic conditions. Our actual results could differ materially from our guidance due to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including those set forth in Risk Factors in Item 1A of our 2023 Form 10-K Report and as updated by our subsequent filings with the SEC. \\n \\n 2024 Guidance Total Company Adjusted EBIT (a) 10 - 12 billion Adjusted Free Cash Flow (a) 6.5 - 7.5 billion Capital spending 8 - 9 billion Ford Credit EBT About 1.5 billion \\n __________ \\n (a) When we provide guidance for Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted Free Cash Flow, we do not provide guidance for the most comparable GAAP measures because, as described in more detail below in Non-GAAP Measures That Supplement GAAP Measures, they include items that are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty. \\n\\nFor full-year 2024, we expect adjusted EBIT of 10 billion to 12 billion and adjusted free cash flow of 6.5 billion to 7.5 billion. \\n \\n On a segment basis, we expect: \\n \\n Ford Pro EBIT of 8 billion to 9 billion driven by continued growth and favorable mix, offset partially by moderated pricing \\n Ford Blue EBIT of 7 billion to 7.5 billion, reflecting a balanced market equation and cost efficiencies offsetting higher labor and product costs \\n Ford Model e EBIT loss of 5 billion to 5.5 billion, driven by continued pricing pressure and investments in new vehicles \\n Ford Credit EBT of about 1.5 billion \\n \\n Our outlook for 2024 assumes: \\n \\n Flat to modest U.S. industry growth at 16 million to 16.5 million \\n Full year of all-new Super Duty, which drives positive pricing and mix in Ford Pro \\n Lower industry pricing \\n 2 billion of cost reductions in material, freight, and manufacturing \\n \\n 54 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements \\n \\n Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations, forecasts, and assumptions by our management and involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: \\n \\n Ford is highly dependent on its suppliers to deliver components in accordance with Ford s production schedule and specifications, and a shortage of or inability to acquire key components or raw materials, such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, can disrupt Ford s production of vehicles; \\n To facilitate access to the raw materials and other components necessary for the production of electric vehicles, Ford has entered into and may, in the future, enter into multi-year commitments to raw material and other suppliers that subject Ford to risks associated with lower future demand for such items as well as costs that fluctuate and are difficult to accurately forecast; \\n Ford s long-term competitiveness depends on the successful execution of Ford+; \\n Ford s vehicles could be affected by defects that result in recall campaigns, increased warranty costs, or delays in new model launches, and the time it takes to improve the quality of our vehicles and services could continue to have an adverse effect on our business; \\n Ford may not realize the anticipated benefits of existing or pending strategic alliances, joint ventures, acquisitions, divestitures, or business strategies; \\n Ford may not realize the anticipated benefits of restructuring actions and such actions may cause Ford to incur significant charges, disrupt our operations, or harm our reputation; \\n Operational information systems, security systems, vehicles, and services could be affected by cybersecurity incidents, ransomware attacks, and other disruptions and impact Ford and Ford Credit as well as their suppliers and dealers; \\n Ford s production, as well as Ford s suppliers production, and/or the ability to deliver products to consumers could be disrupted by labor issues, public health issues, natural or man-made disasters, adverse effects of climate change, financial distress, production difficulties, capacity limitations, or other factors; \\n Failure to develop and deploy secure digital services that appeal to customers could have a negative impact on Ford s business; \\n Ford s ability to maintain a competitive cost structure could be affected by labor or other constraints; \\n Ford s ability to attract, develop, grow, and reward talent is critical to its success and competitiveness; \\n Ford s new and existing products and digital, software, and physical services are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries, and its reputation may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced; \\n Ford s results are dependent on sales of larger, more profitable vehicles, particularly in the United States; \\n With a global footprint and supply chain, Ford s results and operations could be adversely affected by economic or geopolitical developments, including protectionist trade policies such as tariffs, or other events; \\n Industry sales volume can be volatile and could decline if there is a financial crisis, recession, public health emergency, or significant geopolitical event; \\n Ford may face increased price competition or a reduction in demand for its products resulting from industry excess capacity, currency fluctuations, competitive actions, or other factors, particularly for electric vehicles; \\n Inflationary pressure and fluctuations in commodity and energy prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and market value of Ford or Ford Credit s investments, including marketable securities, can have a significant effect on results; \\n Ford and Ford Credit s access to debt, securitization, or derivative markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts could be affected by credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, regulatory requirements, or other factors; \\n The impact of government incentives on Ford s business could be significant, and Ford s receipt of government incentives could be subject to reduction, termination, or clawback; \\n Ford Credit could experience higher-than-expected credit losses, lower-than-anticipated residual values, or higher-than-expected return volumes for leased vehicles; \\n Economic and demographic experience for pension and OPEB plans (e.g., discount rates or investment returns) could be worse than Ford has assumed; \\n Pension and other postretirement liabilities could adversely affect Ford s liquidity and financial condition; \\n Ford and Ford Credit could experience unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations, or adverse publicity arising out of alleged defects in products, services, perceived environmental impacts, or otherwise; \\n Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations; \\n Ford and Ford Credit could be affected by the continued development of more stringent privacy, data use, data protection, and artificial intelligence laws and regulations as well as consumers heightened expectations to safeguard their personal information; and \\n Ford Credit could be subject to new or increased credit regulations, consumer protection regulations, or other regulations. \\n 55 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n We cannot be certain that any expectation, forecast, or assumption made in preparing forward-looking statements will prove accurate, or that any projection will be realized. It is to be expected that there may be differences between projected and actual results. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of their initial issuance, and we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. For additional discussion, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K Report, as updated by our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. \\n 56 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT SUPPLEMENT GAAP MEASURES \\n \\n We use both generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for operational and financial decision making, and to assess Company and segment business performance. The non-GAAP measures listed below are intended to be considered by users as supplemental information to their equivalent GAAP measures, to aid investors in better understanding our financial results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful perspective on underlying operating results and trends, and a means to compare our period-over-period results. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in items or events being adjusted. \\n \\n Company Adjusted EBIT (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Income/(Loss) Attributable to Ford) Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) excludes interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), taxes, and pre-tax special items. This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it focuses on underlying operating results and trends, and improves comparability of our period-over-period results. Our management ordinarily excludes special items from its review of the results of the operating segments for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources. Our categories of pre-tax special items and the applicable significance guideline for each item (which may consist of a group of items related to a single event or action) are as follows: \\n \\n Pre-Tax Special Item Significance Guideline Pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses No minimum Gains and losses on investments in equity securities No minimum Personnel expenses, supplier- and dealer-related costs, and facility-related charges stemming from our efforts to match production capacity and cost structure to market demand and changing model mix Generally 100 million or more Other items that we do not necessarily consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities 500 million or more for individual field service actions; generally 100 million or more for other items \\n \\n When we provide guidance for adjusted EBIT, we do not provide guidance on a net income basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty, including gains and losses on pension and OPEB remeasurements and on investments in equity securities. \\n \\n Company Adjusted EBIT Margin (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Company Net Income/(Loss) Margin) Company Adjusted EBIT margin is Company adjusted EBIT divided by Company revenue. This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it allows users to evaluate our operating results aligned with industry reporting. \\n \\n Adjusted Earnings/(Loss) Per Share (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Earnings/(Loss) Per Share) Measure of Company s diluted net earnings/(loss) per share adjusted for impact of pre-tax special items (described above), tax special items, and restructuring impacts in noncontrolling interests. The measure provides investors with useful information to evaluate performance of our business excluding items not indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities. When we provide guidance for adjusted earnings/(loss) per share, we do not provide guidance on an earnings/(loss) per share basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses. \\n \\n Adjusted Effective Tax Rate (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Effective Tax Rate) Measure of Company s tax rate excluding pre-tax special items (described above) and tax special items. The measure provides an ongoing effective rate which investors find useful for historical comparisons and for forecasting. When we provide guidance for adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide guidance on an effective tax rate basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses. \\n 57 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Company Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Cash Provided By/(Used In) Operating Activities) Measure of Company s operating cash flow excluding Ford Credit s operating cash flows. The measure contains elements management considers operating activities, including Company excluding Ford Credit capital spending, Ford Credit distributions to its parent, and settlement of derivatives. The measure excludes cash outflows for funded pension contributions, restructuring actions, and other items that are considered operating cash flows under U.S. GAAP. This measure is useful to management and investors because it is consistent with management s assessment of the Company s operating cash flow performance. When we provide guidance for Company adjusted free cash flow, we do not provide guidance for net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities because the GAAP measure will include items that are difficult to quantify or predict with reasonable certainty, including cash flows related to the Company's exposures to foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices (separate from any related hedges), Ford Credit's operating cash flows, and cash flows related to special items, including separation payments, each of which individually or in the aggregate could have a significant impact to our net cash provided by/(used in) our operating activities. \\n \\n Adjusted ROIC Calculated as the sum of adjusted net operating profit/(loss) after cash tax from the last four quarters, divided by the average invested capital over the last four quarters. Adjusted Return on Invested Capital Adjusted ROIC provides management and investors with useful information to evaluate the Company s after-cash tax operating return on its invested capital for the period presented.

These items are discussed in more detail in Note 21 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. We report special items separately to allow investors analyzing our results to identify certain infrequent significant items that they may wish to exclude when considering the trend of ongoing operating results. Our pre-tax and tax special items were as follows (in millions): \\n First Quarter 2022 2023 Restructuring Europe (22) (370) China (309) Ford Credit - Brazil (119) Other (36) 12 Subtotal Restructuring (177) (667) Pension and OPEB Gain/(Loss) Pension and OPEB remeasurement (113) Pension settlements and curtailments (46) Subtotal Pension and OPEB Gain/(Loss) (159) Other Items Gain/(loss) on Rivian investment \\n (5,449) (25) Russia suspension of operations/asset write-off (138) Patent matters related to prior calendar years \\n (135) Other 33 (61) Subtotal Other Items (5,689) (86) Total EBIT Special Items (5,866) (912) Provision for/(Benefit from) tax special items (a) (1,192) (144) \\n __________ \\n (a) Includes related tax effect on special items and tax special items. \\n \\n We recorded 912 million of pre-tax special item charges in the first quarter of 2023, driven primarily by restructuring actions in Europe and China. \\n \\n In Note 21 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, special items are reflected as a separate reconciling item, as opposed to being allocated among our segments. This reflects the fact that management excludes these items from its review of operating segment results for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources. \\n 33 \\n\\nItem 2.

Company adjusted EBIT margin was 8.1 in the first quarter of 2023, up 1.4 percentage points from a year ago. \\n \\n The year-over-year increase of 4.9 billion in net income/(loss) in the first quarter of 2023 was driven by the non-recurrence of a mark-to-market loss on our Rivian investment (included in special items in the first quarter of 2022) and higher Ford Blue and Ford Pro EBIT. The year-over-year increase of 1.1 billion in Company adjusted EBIT was driven by higher Ford Blue and Ford Pro EBIT as well as a lower loss in Ford Next. Partial offsets included lower Ford Credit EBT, lower past service pension and OPEB income in Corporate Other, and lower Ford Model e EBIT. \\n \\n The table below shows our first quarter 2023 net income/(loss) attributable to Ford and Company adjusted EBIT by segment. \\n First Quarter 2022 2023 H / (L) Ford Blue 1,328 2,623 1,295 Ford Model e (380) (722) (342) Ford Pro 491 1,366 875 Ford Next (242) (44) 198 Ford Credit 928 303 (625) Corporate Other 201 (147) (348) Company Adjusted EBIT (a) 2,326 3,379 1,053 Interest on Debt (308) (308) Special Items (5,866) (912) (4,954) Taxes / Noncontrolling Interests 738 (402) 1,140 Net Income/(Loss) (3,110) 1,757 4,867 \\n __________ \\n (a) See Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations section for reconciliation to GAAP. \\n 34 \\n\\nItem 2.

The improvement in EBIT was driven by higher net pricing and wholesales. Partial offsets included inflationary cost increases (including commodities), new Super Duty product and launch expense, as well as higher volume-related structural costs, weaker currencies, and higher warranty costs. \\n 36 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Definitions and Information Regarding Ford Blue, Ford Model e, Ford Pro Causal Factors \\n \\n In general, we measure year-over-year change in Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro EBIT using the causal factors listed below, with net pricing and cost variances calculated at present-period volume and mix and exchange: \\n \\n Market Factors (exclude the impact of unconsolidated affiliate wholesale units): \\n Volume and Mix primarily measures EBIT variance from changes in wholesale unit volumes (at prior-year average contribution margin per unit) driven by changes in industry volume, market share, and dealer stocks, as well as the EBIT variance resulting from changes in product mix, including mix among vehicle lines and mix of trim levels and options within a vehicle line \\n Net Pricing primarily measures EBIT variance driven by changes in wholesale unit prices to dealers and marketing incentive programs such as rebate programs, low-rate financing offers, special lease offers, and stock adjustments on dealer inventory \\n \\n Cost: \\n Contribution Costs primarily measures EBIT variance driven by per-unit changes in cost categories that typically vary with volume, such as material costs (including commodity and component costs), warranty expense, and freight and duty costs \\n Structural Costs primarily measures EBIT variance driven by absolute change in cost categories that typically do not have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume. Structural costs include the following cost categories: \\n Manufacturing, Including Volume-Related consists primarily of costs for hourly and salaried manufacturing personnel, plant overhead (such as utilities and taxes), and new product launch expense. These costs could be affected by volume for operating pattern actions such as overtime, line-speed, and shift schedules \\n Engineering and Connectivity consists primarily of costs for vehicle and software engineering personnel, prototype materials, testing, and outside engineering and software services \\n Spending-Related consists primarily of depreciation and amortization of our manufacturing and engineering assets and capital project expense, but also includes asset retirements and operating leases \\n Advertising and Sales Promotions includes costs for advertising, marketing programs, brand promotions, customer mailings and promotional events, and auto shows \\n Administrative, Information Technology, and Selling includes primarily costs for salaried personnel and purchased services related to our staff activities, information technology, and selling functions \\n \\n Exchange primarily measures EBIT variance driven by one or more of the following: (i) transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the relevant entities, (ii) effects of converting functional currency income to U.S. dollars, (iii) effects of remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities of the relevant entities in currencies other than their functional currency, or (iv) results of our foreign currency hedging \\n \\n Other includes a variety of items, such as parts and services earnings, royalties, government incentives, and compensation-related changes \\n \\n In addition, definitions and calculations used in this report include: \\n \\n Wholesales and Revenue wholesale unit volumes include all Ford and Lincoln badged units (whether produced by Ford or by an unconsolidated affiliate) that are sold to dealerships or others, units manufactured by Ford that are sold to other manufacturers, units distributed by Ford for other manufacturers, and local brand units produced by our China joint venture, Jiangling Motors Corporation, Ltd. JMC ), that are sold to dealerships or others. Vehicles sold to daily rental car companies that are subject to a guaranteed repurchase option (i.e., rental repurchase), as well as other sales of finished vehicles for which the recognition of revenue is deferred (e.g., consignments), also are included in wholesale unit volumes. Revenue from certain vehicles in wholesale unit volumes (specifically, Ford badged vehicles produced and distributed by our unconsolidated affiliates, as well as JMC brand vehicles) are not included in our revenue. Excludes transactions between Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro segments \\n \\n Industry Volume and Market Share based, in part, on estimated vehicle registrations; includes medium and heavy duty trucks \\n \\n SAAR seasonally adjusted annual rate \\n 37 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Ford Next Segment \\n \\n The Ford Next segment (formerly Mobility) primarily includes expenses and investments for emerging business initiatives aimed at creating value for Ford in vehicle-adjacent market segments. \\n \\n In this segment, our first quarter 2023 EBIT loss was 44 million, a 198 million improvement from a year ago. Ford Next has evolved from primarily investing in the development of autonomous vehicle capabilities to focus exclusively on incubating and launching new businesses creating strategic value for Ford. \\n 38 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Ford Credit Segment \\n \\n Ford Credit files periodic reports with the SEC that contain additional information regarding Ford Credit.

The loss-to-receivables LTR ratio remained at a low level in the first quarter of 2023, at 35 basis points, though higher than a year ago as losses begin to normalize from historic lows. U.S. auction values in the first quarter of 2023 were lower compared to a year ago. \\n \\n Ford Credit s first quarter 2023 EBT of 303 million was 625 million lower than a year ago, primarily reflecting lower financing margin due to higher borrowing costs, higher credit losses, the non-recurrence of credit loss reserve releases, unfavorable lease residual performance, the non-recurrence of market valuation gains, and unfavorable market valuation adjustments to derivatives (included in Other). \\n 39 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Definitions and Information Regarding Ford Credit Causal Factors \\n \\n In general, we measure year-over-year changes in Ford Credit s EBT using the causal factors listed below: \\n \\n Volume and Mix: \\n Volume primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by changes in average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses at prior period financing margin yield (defined below in financing margin) at prior period exchange rates. Volume changes are primarily driven by the volume of new and used vehicles sold and leased, the extent to which Ford Credit purchases retail financing and operating lease contracts, the extent to which Ford Credit provides wholesale financing, the sales price of the vehicles financed, the level of dealer inventories, Ford-sponsored special financing programs available exclusively through Ford Credit, and the availability of cost-effective funding \\n Mix primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by period-over-period changes in the composition of Ford Credit s average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses by product within each region \\n \\n Financing Margin: \\n Financing margin variance is the period-to-period change in financing margin yield multiplied by the present period average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses at prior period exchange rates. This calculation is performed at the product and country level and then aggregated. Financing margin yield equals revenue, less interest expense and scheduled depreciation for the period, divided by average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses for the same period \\n Financing margin changes are driven by changes in revenue and interest expense. Changes in revenue are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, cost assumptions in pricing, mix of business, and competitive environment. Changes in interest expense are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, borrowing spreads, and asset-liability management \\n \\n Credit Loss: \\n Credit loss is the change in the provision for credit losses at prior period exchange rates. For analysis purposes, management splits the provision for credit losses into net charge-offs and the change in the allowance for credit losses \\n Net charge-off changes are primarily driven by the number of repossessions, severity per repossession, and recoveries. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are primarily driven by changes in historical trends in credit losses and recoveries, changes in the composition and size of Ford Credit s present portfolio, changes in trends in historical used vehicle values, and changes in forward looking macroeconomic conditions. For additional information, refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates - Allowance for Credit Losses section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2022 Form 10-K Report \\n \\n Lease Residual: \\n Lease residual measures changes to residual performance at prior period exchange rates. For analysis purposes, management splits residual performance primarily into residual gains and losses, and the change in accumulated supplemental depreciation \\n Residual gain and loss changes are primarily driven by the number of vehicles returned to Ford Credit and sold, and the difference between the auction value and the depreciated value (which includes both base and accumulated supplemental depreciation) of the vehicles sold. Changes in accumulated supplemental depreciation are primarily driven by changes in Ford Credit s estimate of the expected auction value at the end of the lease term and changes in Ford Credit s estimate of the number of vehicles that will be returned to it and sold. Depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases includes early termination losses on operating leases due to customer default events. For additional information, refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates - Accumulated Depreciation on Vehicles Subject to Operating Leases section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2022 Form 10-K Report \\n \\n Exchange: \\n Reflects changes in EBT driven by the effects of converting functional currency income to U.S. dollars \\n \\n Other: \\n Primarily includes operating expenses, other revenue, insurance expenses, and other income/(loss) at prior period exchange rates \\n Changes in operating expenses are primarily driven by salaried personnel costs, facilities costs, and costs associated with the origination and servicing of customer contracts \\n In general, other income/(loss) changes are primarily driven by changes in earnings related to market valuation adjustments to derivatives (primarily related to movements in interest rates) and other miscellaneous items \\n 40 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n In addition, the following definitions and calculations apply to Ford Credit when used in this Report: \\n \\n Cash (as shown in the Funding Structure and Liquidity tables) Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, excluding amounts related to insurance activities \\n \\n Debt (as shown in the Key Metrics and Leverage tables) Debt on Ford Credit s balance sheets. Includes debt issued in securitizations and payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets and related enhancements. Ford Credit holds the right to receive the excess cash flows not needed to pay the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions \\n \\n Earnings Before Taxes EBT Reflects Ford Credit s income before income taxes \\n \\n Loss-to-Receivables LTR Ratio LTR ratio is calculated using net charge-offs divided by average finance receivables, excluding unearned interest supplements and the allowance for credit losses \\n \\n Return on Equity ROE (as shown in the Key Metrics table) Reflects return on equity calculated by annualizing net income for the period and dividing by monthly average equity for the period \\n \\n Securitization and Restricted Cash (as shown in the Liquidity table) Securitization cash is held for the benefit of the securitization investors (for example, a reserve fund). Restricted cash primarily includes cash held to meet certain local governmental and regulatory reserve requirements and cash held under the terms of certain contractual agreements \\n \\n Securitizations (as shown in the Public Term Funding Plan table) Public securitization transactions, Rule 144A offerings sponsored by Ford Credit, and widely distributed offerings by Ford Credit Canada \\n \\n Term Asset-Backed Securities (as shown in the Funding Structure table) Obligations issued in securitization transactions that are payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets and related enhancements \\n \\n Total Net Receivables (as shown in the Key Metrics table) Includes finance receivables (retail financing and wholesale) sold for legal purposes and net investment in operating leases included in securitization transactions that do not satisfy the requirements for accounting sale treatment. These receivables and operating leases are reported on Ford Credit s balance sheets and are available only for payment of the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions; they are not available to pay the other obligations of Ford Credit or the claims of Ford Credit s other creditors \\n\\n41 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Corporate Other \\n \\n Corporate Other primarily includes corporate governance expenses, past service pension and OPEB income and expense, interest income (excluding Ford Credit interest income and interest earned on our extended service contract portfolio) and gains and losses from our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding gains and losses on investments in equity securities), and foreign exchange derivatives gains and losses associated with intercompany lending. Corporate governance expenses are primarily administrative, delivering benefit on behalf of the global enterprise, that are not allocated to operating segments. These include expenses related to setting and directing global policy, providing oversight and stewardship, and promoting the Company s interests. In the first quarter of 2023, Corporate Other had a 147 million loss, compared with a 201 million profit a year ago. The loss was driven by lower past service pension and OPEB income, which was partially offset by higher Company excluding Ford Credit interest income due to increases in interest rates (primarily Fed Funds). \\n\\nInterest on Debt \\n \\n Interest on Debt, which consists of interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit, was 308 million in the first quarter of 2023, unchanged from a year ago. \\n\\nTaxes \\n \\n Our Provision for/(Benefit from) income taxes for the first quarter of 2023 was a provision of 496 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 23.0 . \\n \\n Our first quarter 2023 adjusted effective tax rate, which excludes special items, was 20.8 . \\n \\n We regularly review our organizational structure and income tax elections for affiliates in non-U.S. and U.S. tax jurisdictions, which may result in changes in affiliates that are included in or excluded from our U.S. tax return. Any future changes to our structure, as well as any changes in income tax laws in the countries that we operate, could cause increases or decreases to our deferred tax balances and related valuation allowances. \\n 42 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \\n \\n At March 31, 2023, total balance sheet cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash, including Ford Credit and entities held for sale, was 39.7 billion. \\n \\n We consider our key balance sheet metrics to be: (i) Company cash, which includes cash equivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash, including cash held for sale, excluding Ford Credit s cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash; and (ii) Company liquidity, which includes Company cash, less restricted cash, and total available committed credit lines, excluding Ford Credit s total available committed credit lines. \\n \\n Company excluding Ford Credit \\n December 31, 2022 March 31, 2023 Balance Sheets B) \\n Company Cash 32.3 28.7 Liquidity 48.0 46.2 Debt (19.9) (19.7) Cash Net of Debt 12.3 9.0 Pension Funded Status B) (a) \\n Funded Plans 4.1 4.1 Unfunded Plans (4.3) (4.3) Total Global Pension (0.2) (0.2) Total Funded Status OPEB (4.5) (4.4) \\n __________ \\n (a) Balances at March 31, 2023 reflect net funded status at December 31, 2022, updated for service and interest cost; expected return on assets; curtailments, settlements, and associated interim remeasurement (where applicable); separation expense; actual benefit payments; and cash contributions. The discount rate and rate of expected return assumptions are unchanged from year-end 2022. \\n \\n Liquidity . One of our key priorities is to maintain a strong balance sheet, while at the same time having resources available to invest in and grow our business. At March 31, 2023, we had Company cash of 28.7 billion and liquidity of 46.2 billion. At March 31, 2023, about 90 of Company cash was held by consolidated entities domiciled in the United States. \\n \\n To be prepared for an economic downturn, we target an ongoing Company cash balance at or above 20 billion plus significant additional liquidity above our Company cash target. We expect to have periods when we will be above or below this amount due to: (i) future cash flow expectations, such as for investments in future opportunities, capital investments, debt maturities, pension contributions, or restructuring requirements, (ii) short-term timing differences, and (iii) changes in the global economic environment. \\n \\n Our Company cash investments primarily include U.S. Department of Treasury obligations, federal agency securities, bank time deposits with investment-grade institutions, investment-grade corporate securities, investment-grade commercial paper, and debt obligations of a select group of non-U.S. governments, non-U.S. governmental agencies, and supranational institutions. The average maturity of these investments is approximately one year and adjusted based on market conditions and liquidity needs. We monitor our Company cash levels and average maturity on a daily basis. \\n 43 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Material Cash Requirements. Our material cash requirements include: \\n \\n Capital expenditures (for additional information, see the Changes in Company Cash section below) and other payments for engineering, software, product development, and implementation of our plans for battery electric vehicles \\n \\n Purchase of raw materials and components to support the manufacturing and sale of vehicles (including electric vehicles), parts, and accessories (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table and the accompanying description of our Purchase obligations in the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Company Excluding Ford Credit section in Item 7 of our 2022 Form 10-K Report) \\n \\n Marketing incentive payments to dealers \\n \\n Payments for warranty and field service actions (for additional information, see Note 20 of the Notes to the Financial Statements herein) \\n \\n Debt repayments (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table in the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Company Excluding Ford Credit section in Item 7 and Note 19 of the Notes the Financial Statements in our 2022 Form 10-K Report) \\n \\n Discretionary and mandatory payments to our global pension plans (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table in the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Company Excluding Ford Credit section in Item 7 of our 2022 Form 10-K Report, the Changes in Company Cash section below, and Note 13 of the Notes to the Financial Statements herein) \\n \\n Employee wages, benefits, and incentives \\n \\n Operating lease payments (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table in the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Company Excluding Ford Credit section in Item 7 and Note 18 of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2022 Form 10-K Report) \\n \\n Cash effects related to the restructuring of our business \\n \\n Strategic acquisitions and investments to grow our business, including electrification \\n \\n Subject to approval by our Board of Directors, shareholder distributions in the form of dividend payments and/or a share repurchase program (including share repurchases to offset the anti-dilutive effect of increased shared-based compensation) may require the expenditure of a material amount of cash. Moreover, we may be subject to additional material cash requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, e.g., legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions, and other matters. \\n \\n We plan to utilize our liquidity (as described above) and our cash flows from business operations to fund our material cash requirements. \\n\\n44 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Changes in Company Cash. In managing our business, we classify changes in Company cash into operating and non-operating items. Operating items include: Company adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit EBT, capital spending, depreciation and tooling amortization, changes in working capital, Ford Credit distributions, interest on debt, cash taxes, and all other and timing differences (including timing differences between accrual-based EBIT and associated cash flows). Non-operating items include: restructuring costs, changes in Company debt excluding Ford Credit, contributions to funded pension plans, shareholder distributions, and other items (including gains and losses on investments in equity securities, acquisitions and divestitures, equity investments, and other transactions with Ford Credit). \\n \\n With respect to Changes in working capital, in general, the Company excluding Ford Credit carries relatively low trade receivables compared with our trade payables because the majority of our wholesales are financed (primarily by Ford Credit) immediately upon the sale of vehicles to dealers, which generally occurs shortly after being produced. In contrast, our trade payables are based primarily on industry-standard production supplier payment terms of about 45 days. As a result, our cash flow deteriorates if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) decrease while trade payables continue to become due. Conversely, our cash flow improves if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) increase while new trade payables are generally not due for about 45 days. For example, the suspension of production at most of our assembly plants and lower industry volumes due to COVID-19 in early 2020 resulted in an initial deterioration of our cash flow, while the subsequent resumption of manufacturing operations and return to pre-COVID-19 production levels at most of our assembly plants resulted in a subsequent improvement of our cash flow. Even in normal economic conditions, however, these working capital balances generally are subject to seasonal changes that can impact cash flow. For example, we typically experience cash flow timing differences associated with inventories and payables due to our annual summer and December shutdown periods when production, and therefore inventories and wholesale volumes, are usually at their lowest levels, while payables continue to come due and be paid. The net impact of this typically results in cash outflows from changes in our working capital balances during these shutdown periods. \\n \\n Our finished product inventory at March 31, 2023 was higher than at December 31, 2022, reflecting higher in-transit and in-plant inventory. \\n \\n In response to, or in anticipation of, supplier disruptions, we may stockpile certain components or raw materials to help prevent disruption in our production of vehicles. Such actions could have a short-term adverse impact on our cash and increase our inventory. Moreover, in order to secure critical materials for production of electric vehicles, we have entered into and plan to continue to enter into offtake agreements with raw material suppliers and make investments in certain raw material and battery suppliers, including contributing up to 6.6 billion in capital to BlueOval SK, LLC over a five-year period ending in 2026. Such investments, which are part of our plan to invest over 50 billion in electric vehicles through 2026, could have an additional adverse impact on our cash in the near-term. \\n \\n The terms of the offtake agreements we have entered into, and those we may enter into in the future, vary by transaction, though they generally obligate us to purchase a certain percentage or minimum amount of output produced by the counterparty over an agreed upon period of time. The purchase price mechanism included in the offtake agreement is typically based on the market price of the material at the time of delivery. The terms may also include conditions to our obligation to purchase the materials, such as quality or minimum output. Subject to satisfaction of those conditions, we will be obligated to purchase the materials at the cost determined by the purchase price mechanism. As of March 31, 2023, our forecasted expenditures for the maximum quantity that we are committed to purchase under these offtake agreements, subject to certain conditions, total about 4.3 billion through 2030 based on our present pricing forecast; however, our forecasted prices could fluctuate significantly from period to period, which would result in volatility in the estimate of our overall obligation. In addition, we plan to continue to enter into offtake agreements with raw material suppliers, the costs under which we expect to be significant. Based on the offtake agreements we have entered into thus far, the earliest date by which we could be obligated to purchase any output, subject to satisfaction of the applicable conditions, will be in 2024. \\n \\n Financial institutions participate in a supply chain finance SCF program that enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their Ford receivables (i.e., our payment obligations to the suppliers) to the financial institutions on a non-recourse basis in order to be paid earlier than our payment terms provide. Our suppliers voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms, the amounts we pay, or our liquidity. We have no economic interest in a supplier s decision to participate in the SCF program, and we do not provide any guarantees in connection with it. As of March 31, 2023, the outstanding amount of Ford receivables that suppliers elected to sell to the SCF financial institutions was 265 million. The amount settled through the SCF program during the first quarter of 2023 was 452 million. \\n\\n45 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Changes in Company cash excluding Ford Credit are summarized below (in billions): \\n First Quarter 2022 2023 Company Excluding Ford Credit Company Adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit (a) 1.4 3.1 Capital spending (1.3) (1.8) Depreciation and tooling amortization 1.3 1.3 Net spending (0.1) (0.5) Receivables 0.4 Inventory (2.7) (2.0) Trade Payables 1.5 0.3 Changes in working capital (1.2) (1.2) Ford Credit distributions 1.0 Interest on debt and cash taxes (0.3) (0.6) All other and timing differences (1.3) (0.1) Company adjusted free cash flow (a) (0.6) 0.7 Restructuring (0.1) Changes in debt (0.3) (0.2) Funded pension contributions (0.2) (0.1) Shareholder distributions (0.4) (3.2) All other (b) (6.2) (0.7) Change in cash (7.8) (3.6) \\n __________ \\n (a) See Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations section for reconciliation to GAAP. \\n (b) 2022 includes a 5.4B mark-to-market loss on our Rivian investment. \\n Note: Numbers may not sum due to rounding. \\n \\n Our first quarter 2023 Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities was positive 2.8 billion, an increase of 3.9 billion from a year ago (see page 58 for additional information), driven primarily by higher net income. Company adjusted free cash flow was 0.7 billion, 1.3 billion higher than a year ago, driven by higher adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit and favorable timing differences, offset partially by lower Ford Credit distributions and higher capital spending. \\n \\n Capital spending was 1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2023, an increase of 0.4 billion from a year ago. We continue to expect full year 2023 capital spending to be in the range of 8 billion to 9 billion. \\n \\n First quarter 2023 working capital impact was 1.2 billion negative, driven by higher inventory, offset partially by higher trade payables and lower receivables, each compared to December 31, 2022. All other and timing differences were negative 0.1 billion. Timing differences include differences between accrual-based EBIT and the associated cash flows (e.g., pension and OPEB income or expense; compensation payments; marketing incentive and warranty payments to dealers). \\n \\n In the first quarter of 2023, we contributed 125 million to our global funded pension plans. We continue to expect to contribute between 500 million and 600 million to our global funded pension plans in 2023. \\n \\n Shareholder distributions were 3.2 billion in the first quarter of 2023, all of which was attributable to our regular and supplemental dividend. \\n 46 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Available Credit Lines . Total Company committed credit lines, excluding Ford Credit, at March 31, 2023 were 19.3 billion, consisting of 13.5 billion of our corporate credit facility, 2.0 billion of our supplemental revolving credit facility, 1.75 billion of our 364-day revolving credit facility, and 2.1 billion of local credit facilities. At March 31, 2023, the utilized portion of the corporate credit facility was 17 million, representing amounts utilized for letters of credit. In addition, 1.7 billion of committed Company credit lines, excluding Ford Credit, was utilized under local credit facilities for our affiliates as of March 31, 2023. \\n \\n Our corporate, supplemental, and 364-day revolving credit facilities were amended as of April 26, 2023 to extend the maturity dates of the commitments under each facility. Following the corporate credit facility amendment, 3.4 billion of commitments mature on April 26, 2026 and 10.1 billion of commitments mature on April 26, 2028. Following the supplemental revolving credit facility amendment, 0.1 billion of commitments mature on September 29, 2024 and 1.9 billion of commitments mature on April 26, 2026. Following the 364-day revolving credit facility amendment, 1.8 billion of commitments mature on April 24, 2024. \\n \\n The corporate, supplemental, and 364-day credit agreements include certain sustainability-linked targets, pursuant to which the applicable margin and facility fees may be adjusted if Ford achieves, or fails to achieve, the specified targets related to global manufacturing facility greenhouse gas emissions, renewable electricity consumption, and Ford Europe CO 2 tailpipe emissions. \\n \\n The corporate credit facility is unsecured and free of material adverse change conditions to borrowing, restrictive financial covenants (for example, interest or fixed-charge coverage ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and minimum net worth requirements), and credit rating triggers that could limit our ability to obtain funding or trigger early repayment. The corporate credit facility contains a liquidity covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum of 4 billion in aggregate of domestic cash, cash equivalents, and loaned and marketable securities and/or availability under the corporate credit facility, supplemental revolving credit facility, and 364-day revolving credit facility. The terms and conditions of the supplemental and 364-day revolving credit facilities are consistent with our corporate credit facility. Ford Credit has been designated as a subsidiary borrower under the corporate credit facility and the 364-day revolving credit facility. \\n \\n Each of the corporate credit facility, supplemental revolving credit facility, and 364-day revolving credit facility include a covenant that requires us to provide guarantees from certain of our subsidiaries in the event that our senior, unsecured, long-term debt does not maintain at least two investment grade ratings from Fitch, Moody s, and S P. The following subsidiaries have provided unsecured guarantees to the lenders under the credit facilities: Ford Component Sales, LLC; Ford European Holdings Inc.; Ford Global Technologies, LLC; Ford Holdings LLC (the parent company of Ford Credit); Ford International Capital LLC; Ford Mexico Holdings LLC; Ford Motor Service Company; Ford Next LLC; Ford Trading Company, LLC; and Ford Van Dyke Investment Fund, Inc. \\n \\n Debt. As shown in Note 14 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, at March 31, 2023, Company debt excluding Ford Credit was 19.7 billion. This balance is 0.2 billion lower than at December 31, 2022. \\n \\n Leverage. We manage Company debt (excluding Ford Credit) levels with a leverage framework that targets investment grade credit ratings through a normal business cycle. The leverage framework includes a ratio of total Company debt (excluding Ford Credit), underfunded pension liabilities, operating leases, and other adjustments, divided by Company adjusted EBIT (excluding Ford Credit EBT), and further adjusted to exclude depreciation and tooling amortization (excluding Ford Credit). \\n \\n Ford Credit s leverage is calculated as a separate business as described in the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Ford Credit Segment section of Item 2. Ford Credit is self-funding and its debt, which is used to fund its operations, is separate from our Company debt excluding Ford Credit. \\n 47 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Ford Credit Segment \\n \\n Ford Credit remains well capitalized with a strong balance sheet and funding diversified across platforms and markets. Ford Credit saw sequential improvement in liquidity, securitized funding mix, and financial statement leverage during the quarter and ended the first quarter of 2023 with 26 billion of liquidity, up 5 billion from year-end. Ford Credit continues to have robust access to the capital markets, completing 12 billion of public term issuances through May 1, 2023. \\n \\n Key elements of Ford Credit s funding strategy include: \\n \\n Maintain strong liquidity and funding diversity \\n Prudently access public markets \\n Continue to leverage retail deposit funding in Europe \\n Flexibility to increase ABS mix as needed; preserving assets and committed capacity \\n Target financial statement leverage of 9:1 to 10:1 \\n Maintain self-liquidating balance sheet \\n \\n Ford Credit s liquidity profile continues to be diverse, robust, and focused on maintaining liquidity levels that meet its business and funding requirements. Ford Credit regularly stress tests its balance sheet and liquidity to ensure that it can continue to meet its financial obligations through economic cycles. \\n \\n The following table shows funding for Ford Credit s net receivables (in billions): \\n March 31, 2022 December 31, 2022 March 31, 2023 Funding Structure Term unsecured debt 55.1 48.3 49.3 Term asset-backed securities 47.1 56.4 55.0 Ford Interest Advantage / Retail Deposits 13.3 14.3 15.3 Other 1.7 2.6 2.2 Equity 12.1 11.9 12.2 Adjustments for cash (11.9) (11.2) (10.2) Total Net Receivables 117.4 122.3 123.8 Securitized Funding as Percent of Total Debt 40.8 47.4 46.0 \\n \\n Net receivables were 123.8 billion at March 31, 2023 and were funded primarily with term unsecured debt and term asset-backed securities. Securitized funding as a percent of total debt was 46.0 at the end of the first quarter of 2023. \\n \\n Public Term Funding Plan.

At March 31, 2023, Ford Credit s net liquidity available for use was 26 billion, 5 billion higher than year-end 2022, reflecting strong access to public funding markets and the addition of 3.1 billion in committed asset-backed capacity. At March 31, 2023, Ford Credit s liquidity sources, including cash, committed asset-backed facilities, and unsecured credit facilities, totaled 53.2 billion, up 2.3 billion from year-end 2022. \\n \\n Material Cash Requirements. Ford Credit s material cash requirements include: (1) the purchase of retail financing and operating lease contracts from dealers and providing wholesale financing for dealers to finance new and used vehicles; and (2) debt repayments (for additional information on debt, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table in the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Company Excluding Ford Credit section in Item 7 and Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2022 Form 10-K Report). In addition, subject to approval by Ford Credit s Board of Directors, shareholder distributions may require the expenditure of a material amount of cash. Moreover, Ford Credit may be subject to additional material cash requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, e.g., legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions, and other matters. \\n \\n Ford Credit plans to utilize its liquidity (as described above) and its cash flows from business operations to fund its material cash requirements. \\n \\n Funding and Liquidity Risks. Ford Credit s funding plan is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control, including disruption in the capital markets, that could impact both unsecured debt and asset-backed securities issuance and the effects of regulatory changes on the financial markets. Refer to the Liquidity - Ford Credit Segment - Funding and Liquidity Risks section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2022 Form 10-K Report for more information. \\n \\n 49 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Leverage. Ford Credit uses leverage, or the debt-to-equity ratio, to make various business decisions, including evaluating and establishing pricing for finance receivable and operating lease financing, and assessing its capital structure. \\n \\n The table below shows the calculation of Ford Credit s financial statement leverage (in billions): \\n March 31, 2022 December 31, 2022 March 31, 2023 Leverage Calculation Debt 115.5 119.0 119.6 Equity (a) 12.1 11.9 12.2 Financial statement leverage (to 1) 9.5 10.0 9.8 \\n __________ \\n (a) Total shareholder s interest reported on Ford Credit s balance sheets. \\n \\n Ford Credit plans its leverage by considering market conditions and the risk characteristics of its business. At March 31, 2023, Ford Credit s financial statement leverage was 9.8:1. Ford Credit targets financial statement leverage in the range of 9:1 to 10:1. \\n\\nTotal Company \\n \\n Pension Plans - Funded Balances. As of March 31, 2023, our total Company pension underfunded status reported on our consolidated balance sheets was 0.2 billion and reflects the net funded status at December 31, 2022, updated for: service and interest cost; expected return on assets; curtailments, settlements, and associated interim remeasurement (where applicable); separation expense; actual benefit payments; and cash contributions. For plans without interim remeasurement, the discount rate and rate of expected return assumptions are unchanged from year-end 2022. \\n \\n Return on Invested Capital ROIC ). We analyze total Company performance using an adjusted ROIC financial metric based on an after-tax, rolling four quarter average.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n CREDIT RATINGS \\n \\n Our short-term and long-term debt is rated by four credit rating agencies designated as nationally recognized statistical rating organizations NRSROs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission: DBRS, Fitch, Moody s, and S P. \\n \\n In several markets, locally recognized rating agencies also rate us. A credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the credit risk associated with a corporate entity or particular securities issued by that entity. Rating agencies ratings of us are based on information provided by us and other sources. Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n OUTLOOK \\n \\n We provided 2023 Company guidance in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K dated May 2, 2023. Our actual results could differ materially from our guidance due to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including those set forth in Risk Factors in Item 1A of our 2022 Form 10-K Report and as updated by our subsequent filings with the SEC. \\n 2023 Guidance Total Company Adjusted EBIT (a) 9 - 11 billion Adjusted Free Cash Flow (a) About 6 billion Capital spending 8 - 9 billion Ford Credit EBT About 1.3 billion \\n __________ \\n (a) When we provide guidance for adjusted EBIT and adjusted free cash flow, we do not provide guidance for the most comparable GAAP measures because, as described in more detail below in Non-GAAP Measures That Supplement GAAP Measures, they include items that are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty. \\n \\n For full-year 2023, we continue to expect adjusted EBIT of 9 billion to 11 billion and adjusted free cash flow of about 6 billion. \\n \\n On a segment basis, we expect: \\n \\n Ford Blue to deliver full-year EBIT of about 7 billion. Cost improvements and higher industry volumes will likely be offset partially by pricing headwinds, as inventory stocks continue to normalize and industry incentives rise throughout the year, along with adverse exchange. \\n Ford Model e to report an EBIT loss of around 3 billion, largely reflecting disciplined investments in new products and capacity. \\n Ford Pro s EBIT to nearly double from full-year 2022 to around 6 billion. The gain is driven by improved pricing and volume, including the benefits from the launch of our all-new Super Duty. \\n Ford Credit EBT to be about 1.3 billion. \\n \\n Our outlook for 2023 assumes the headwinds and tailwinds below. \\n \\n Headwinds: \\n Global economic uncertainty \\n Higher industrywide customer incentives as vehicle supply and demand rebalances \\n Lower past service pension income and exchange \\n Growth-related investments (e.g., customer experience, connected services, and capital expenditures) \\n \\n Tailwinds: \\n Improvement in the supply chain and higher industry volume with a seasonally adjusted annual rate SAAR of about 15 million in the United States and about 13 million in Europe \\n Launch of our all-new Super Duty \\n Lower cost of goods sold, including materials and commodities \\n 52 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements \\n \\n Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations, forecasts, and assumptions by our management and involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: \\n \\n Ford and Ford Credit s financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by public health issues, including epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19; \\n Ford is highly dependent on its suppliers to deliver components in accordance with Ford s production schedule and specifications, and a shortage of or inability to acquire key components, such as semiconductors, or raw materials, such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, can disrupt Ford s production of vehicles; \\n To facilitate access to the raw materials necessary for the production of electric vehicles, Ford has entered into, and expects to continue to enter into, multi-year commitments to raw material suppliers that subject Ford to risks associated with lower future demand for such materials as well as costs that fluctuate and are difficult to accurately forecast; \\n Ford s long-term competitiveness depends on the successful execution of Ford+; \\n Ford s vehicles could be affected by defects that result in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, or increased warranty costs; \\n Ford may not realize the anticipated benefits of existing or pending strategic alliances, joint ventures, acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings, or new business strategies; \\n Operational systems, security systems, vehicles, and services could be affected by cyber incidents, ransomware attacks, and other disruptions and impact Ford and Ford Credit as well as their suppliers and dealers; \\n Ford s production, as well as Ford s suppliers production, and/or the ability to deliver products to consumers could be disrupted by labor issues, natural or man-made disasters, adverse effects of climate change, financial distress, production difficulties, capacity limitations, or other factors; \\n Ford s ability to maintain a competitive cost structure could be affected by labor or other constraints; \\n Ford s ability to attract and retain talented, diverse, and highly skilled employees is critical to its success and competitiveness; \\n Ford s new and existing products and digital, software, and physical services are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries and its reputation may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced; \\n Ford s results are dependent on sales of larger, more profitable vehicles, particularly in the United States; \\n With a global footprint, Ford s results could be adversely affected by economic or geopolitical developments, including protectionist trade policies such as tariffs, or other events; \\n Industry sales volume can be volatile and could decline if there is a financial crisis, recession, or significant geopolitical event; \\n Ford may face increased price competition or a reduction in demand for its products resulting from industry excess capacity, currency fluctuations, competitive actions, or other factors; \\n Inflationary pressure and fluctuations in commodity and energy prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and market value of Ford or Ford Credit s investments, including marketable securities, can have a significant effect on results; \\n Ford and Ford Credit s access to debt, securitization, or derivative markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts could be affected by credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, regulatory requirements, or other factors; \\n The impact of government incentives on Ford s business could be significant, and Ford s receipt of government incentives could be subject to reduction, termination, or clawback; \\n Ford Credit could experience higher-than-expected credit losses, lower-than-anticipated residual values, or higher-than-expected return volumes for leased vehicles; \\n Economic and demographic experience for pension and OPEB plans (e.g., discount rates or investment returns) could be worse than Ford has assumed; \\n Pension and other postretirement liabilities could adversely affect Ford s liquidity and financial condition; \\n Ford and Ford Credit could experience unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations, or adverse publicity arising out of alleged defects in products, services, perceived environmental impacts, or otherwise; \\n Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations; \\n Ford and Ford Credit could be affected by the continued development of more stringent privacy, data use, and data protection laws and regulations as well as consumers heightened expectations to safeguard their personal information; and \\n Ford Credit could be subject to new or increased credit regulations, consumer protection regulations, or other regulations. \\n 53 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n We cannot be certain that any expectation, forecast, or assumption made in preparing forward-looking statements will prove accurate, or that any projection will be realized. It is to be expected that there may be differences between projected and actual results. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of their initial issuance, and we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. For additional discussion, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2022 Form 10-K Report, as updated by our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. \\n 54 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT SUPPLEMENT GAAP MEASURES \\n \\n We use both generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for operational and financial decision making, and to assess Company and segment business performance. The non-GAAP measures listed below are intended to be considered by users as supplemental information to their equivalent GAAP measures, to aid investors in better understanding our financial results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful perspective on underlying operating results and trends, and a means to compare our period-over-period results. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in items or events being adjusted. \\n \\n Company Adjusted EBIT (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Income/(Loss) Attributable to Ford) Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) excludes interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), taxes, and pre-tax special items. This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it focuses on underlying operating results and trends, and improves comparability of our period-over-period results. Our management ordinarily excludes special items from its review of the results of the operating segments for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources. Our categories of pre-tax special items and the applicable significance guideline for each item (which may consist of a group of items related to a single event or action) are as follows: \\n \\n Pre-Tax Special Item Significance Guideline Pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses No minimum Gains and losses on investments in equity securities No minimum Personnel expenses, supplier- and dealer-related costs, and facility-related charges stemming from our efforts to match production capacity and cost structure to market demand and changing model mix Generally 100 million or more Other items that we do not necessarily consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities 500 million or more for individual field service actions; generally 100 million or more for other items \\n \\n When we provide guidance for adjusted EBIT, we do not provide guidance on a net income basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty, including gains and losses on pension and OPEB remeasurements and on investments in equity securities. \\n \\n Company Adjusted EBIT Margin (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Company Net Income/(Loss) Margin) Company Adjusted EBIT margin is Company adjusted EBIT divided by Company revenue. This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it allows users to evaluate our operating results aligned with industry reporting. \\n \\n Adjusted Earnings/(Loss) Per Share (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Earnings/(Loss) Per Share) Measure of Company s diluted net earnings/(loss) per share adjusted for impact of pre-tax special items (described above), tax special items, and restructuring impacts in noncontrolling interests. The measure provides investors with useful information to evaluate performance of our business excluding items not indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities. When we provide guidance for adjusted earnings/(loss) per share, we do not provide guidance on an earnings/(loss) per share basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses. \\n \\n Adjusted Effective Tax Rate (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Effective Tax Rate) Measure of Company s tax rate excluding pre-tax special items (described above) and tax special items. The measure provides an ongoing effective rate which investors find useful for historical comparisons and for forecasting. When we provide guidance for adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide guidance on an effective tax rate basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses. \\n 55 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Company Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Cash Provided By/(Used In) Operating Activities) Measure of Company s operating cash flow excluding Ford Credit s operating cash flows. The measure contains elements management considers operating activities, including Company excluding Ford Credit capital spending, Ford Credit distributions to its parent, and settlement of derivatives. The measure excludes cash outflows for funded pension contributions, restructuring actions, and other items that are considered operating cash flows under U.S. GAAP. This measure is useful to management and investors because it is consistent with management s assessment of the Company s operating cash flow performance. When we provide guidance for Company adjusted free cash flow, we do not provide guidance for net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities because the GAAP measure will include items that are difficult to quantify or predict with reasonable certainty, including cash flows related to the Company's exposures to foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices (separate from any related hedges), Ford Credit's operating cash flows, and cash flows related to special items, including separation payments, each of which individually or in the aggregate could have a significant impact to our net cash provided by/(used in) our operating activities. \\n \\n Adjusted ROIC Calculated as the sum of adjusted net operating profit/(loss) after cash tax from the last four quarters, divided by the average invested capital over the last four quarters. Adjusted Return on Invested Capital Adjusted ROIC provides management and investors with useful information to evaluate the Company s after-cash tax operating return on its invested capital for the period presented. Adjusted net operating profit/(loss) after cash tax measures operating results less special items, interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), and certain pension/OPEB costs. Average invested capital is the sum of average balance sheet equity, debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), and net pension/OPEB liability. \\n 56 \\n\\nItem 2.

       "1  ITEM 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \\n\\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS \\n \\n Electric Vehicle Market \\n \\n Although we continue to invest in our electric vehicle strategy, we have observed lower-than-anticipated industrywide electric vehicle adoption rates and near-term pricing pressures, which has led us, and may in the future lead us, to adjust our spending, production, and/or product launches to better match the pace of electric vehicle adoption. As a result, we have incurred, and may continue to incur, expenses related to payments to our electric vehicle-related suppliers (battery, raw material, or otherwise), inventory adjustments, or other matters. Further, significant unexpected changes in the EV demand environment have led, and may in the future lead, to incremental competitive pricing actions. These market dynamics may continue to occur, which could have a substantial impact on our business. \\n \\n As a result, in the first quarter of 2024, we recorded about 0.4 billion of expenses and about 0.3 billion of adjustments related to revenue recognized in prior periods. In addition, slower-than-anticipated development of the electric vehicle market may impact our strategy to comply with regulatory standards, and, in some cases, we plan to utilize credits purchased from third parties to demonstrate regulatory compliance or we may need to modify our product offerings. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K Report and as updated by our subsequent filings with the SEC for a discussion of the risks related to lower-than-anticipated electric vehicle volumes and our planned transition to a greater mix of electric vehicles. \\n\\n34 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \\n \\n In the first quarter of 2024, the net income attributable to Ford Motor Company was 1,332 million, and Company adjusted EBIT was 2,763 million. \\n \\n Net income/(loss) includes certain items special items that are excluded from Company adjusted EBIT. These items are discussed in more detail in Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. We report special items separately to allow investors analyzing our results to identify certain infrequent significant items that they may wish to exclude when considering the trend of ongoing operating results. Our pre-tax and tax special items were as follows (in millions): \\n First Quarter 2023 2024 Restructuring (by Geography) Europe (370) (321) China (309) North America Hourly Buyouts (260) Other 12 Subtotal Restructuring (667) (581) Other Items Extended Oakville EV Program Changeover \\n (291) Other (including gains/(losses) on investments) (86) 2 Subtotal Other Items (86) (289) Pension and OPEB Gain/(Loss) Pension and OPEB remeasurement (113) 11 Pension settlements and curtailments (46) (14) Subtotal Pension and OPEB Gain/(Loss) (159) (3) Total EBIT Special Items (912) (873) Provision for/(Benefit from) tax special items (a) (144) (220) \\n __________ \\n (a) Includes related tax effect on special items and tax special items. \\n \\n We recorded 873 million of pre-tax special item charges in the first quarter of 2024, driven primarily by restructuring actions in Europe, the extended duration of the EV program changeover at Oakville, and buyouts for hourly employees in North America. \\n \\n In Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, special items are reflected as a separate reconciling item, as opposed to being allocated among our segments. This reflects the fact that management excludes these items from its review of operating segment results for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources. \\n 35 \\n\\nItem 2.

First quarter 2024 revenue decreased 13 , driven by lower wholesales and unfavorable mix, offset partially by higher currency-related pricing in South America. \\n \\n Ford Blue s first quarter 2024 EBIT was 905 million, a decrease of 1.7 billion from a year ago, with an EBIT margin of 4.2 . The lower EBIT was driven by lower wholesales and unfavorable mix (primarily fewer F-150s due to the new model launch). Higher costs reflected primarily material cost for new products and higher warranty costs, offset partially by lower structural costs. \\n \\n 37 \\n\\nItem 2.

First quarter 2024 revenue decreased 84 , primarily driven by the accrual impacts for units in dealer stock at December 31, 2023 (about 0.3 billion) as well as lower net pricing. \\n \\n Ford Model e s first quarter 2024 EBIT loss was 1.3 billion, a 598 million higher loss than a year ago. The lower EBIT was primarily driven by lower net pricing and exchange. Favorable cost performance included lower battery raw materials and engineering expense, offset partially by volume-related obligations of about 90 million for batteries and certain other commodities and higher manufacturing costs ahead of the upcoming Explorer EV launch in Europe. \\n\\nFord Pro Segment \\n First Quarter Key Metrics 2023 2024 H / (L) Wholesale Units (000) (a) 337 409 71 Revenue M) 13,249 18,019 4,770 EBIT M) 1,366 3,008 1,642 EBIT Margin ) 10.3 16.7 6.4 ppts \\n __________ \\n (a) Includes Ford brand vehicles produced and sold by our unconsolidated affiliate Ford Otosan in T rkiye (about 22,000 units in Q1 2023 and 18,000 units in Q1 2024). \\n \\n Change in EBIT by Causal Factor (in millions) First Quarter 2023 EBIT \\n 1,366 Volume / Mix 1,795 Net Pricing 680 Cost (1,054) Exchange 159 Other 62 First Quarter 2024 EBIT \\n 3,008 \\n \\n In the first quarter of 2024, Ford Pro s wholesales increased 21 from a year ago, driven by a full quarter of the all new Super Duty truck, which launched in the first quarter of 2023, and higher sales of the Transit range of vans. First quarter 2024 revenue increased 36 , driven by higher wholesales, favorable mix, and higher net pricing. \\n \\n Ford Pro s first quarter 2024 EBIT was 3.0 billion, an increase of 1.6 billion from a year ago, with an EBIT margin of 16.7 . The improvement in EBIT was driven by higher volume, favorable mix, and higher net pricing. Higher cost was a partial offset, including material costs (primarily new product-related and inflationary increases), higher growth-related structural costs (including engineering and manufacturing), and higher warranty costs. \\n 38 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Definitions and Information Regarding Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro Causal Factors \\n \\n In general, we measure year-over-year change in Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro segment EBIT using the causal factors listed below, with net pricing and cost variances calculated at present-period volume and mix and exchange: \\n \\n Market Factors (exclude the impact of unconsolidated affiliate wholesale units): \\n Volume and Mix primarily measures EBIT variance from changes in wholesale unit volumes (at prior-year average contribution margin per unit) driven by changes in industry volume, market share, and dealer stocks, as well as the EBIT variance resulting from changes in product mix, including mix among vehicle lines and mix of trim levels and options within a vehicle line \\n Net Pricing primarily measures EBIT variance driven by changes in wholesale unit prices to dealers and marketing incentive programs such as rebate programs, low-rate financing offers, special lease offers, and stock adjustments on dealer inventory \\n \\n Cost: \\n Contribution Costs primarily measures EBIT variance driven by per-unit changes in cost categories that typically vary with volume, such as material costs (including commodity and component costs), warranty expense, and freight and duty costs \\n Structural Costs primarily measures EBIT variance driven by absolute change in cost categories that typically do not have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume. Structural costs include the following cost categories: \\n Manufacturing, Including Volume-Related consists primarily of costs for hourly and salaried manufacturing personnel, plant overhead (such as utilities and taxes), and new product launch expense. These costs could be affected by volume for operating pattern actions such as overtime, line-speed, and shift schedules \\n Engineering and Connectivity consists primarily of costs for vehicle and software engineering personnel, prototype materials, testing, and outside engineering and software services \\n Spending-Related consists primarily of depreciation and amortization of our manufacturing and engineering assets, but also includes asset retirements and operating leases \\n Advertising and Sales Promotions includes costs for advertising, marketing programs, brand promotions, customer mailings and promotional events, and auto shows \\n Administrative, Information Technology, and Selling includes primarily costs for salaried personnel and purchased services related to our staff activities, information technology, and selling functions \\n \\n Exchange primarily measures EBIT variance driven by one or more of the following: (i) transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the relevant entities, (ii) effects of converting functional currency income to U.S. dollars, (iii) effects of remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities of the relevant entities in currencies other than their functional currency, or (iv) results of our foreign currency hedging \\n \\n Other includes a variety of items, such as parts and services earnings, royalties, government incentives, and compensation-related changes \\n \\n In addition, definitions and calculations used in this report include: \\n \\n Wholesales and Revenue wholesale unit volumes include all Ford and Lincoln badged units (whether produced by Ford or by an unconsolidated affiliate) that are sold to dealerships or others, units manufactured by Ford that are sold to other manufacturers, units distributed by Ford for other manufacturers, and local brand units produced by our China joint venture, Jiangling Motors Corporation, Ltd. JMC ), that are sold to dealerships or others. Vehicles sold to daily rental car companies that are subject to a guaranteed repurchase option (i.e., rental repurchase), as well as other sales of finished vehicles for which the recognition of revenue is deferred (e.g., consignments), also are included in wholesale unit volumes. Revenue from certain vehicles in wholesale unit volumes (specifically, Ford badged vehicles produced and distributed by our unconsolidated affiliates, as well as JMC brand vehicles) are not included in our revenue. Excludes transactions between Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro segments \\n \\n Industry Volume and Market Share based, in part, on estimated vehicle registrations; includes medium and heavy duty trucks \\n \\n SAAR seasonally adjusted annual rate \\n 39 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Ford Next Segment \\n \\n The Ford Next segment primarily includes expenses and investments for emerging business initiatives aimed at creating value for Ford in vehicle-adjacent market segments. Ford Next s first quarter 2024 EBIT loss was 9 million, a 35 million improvement from a year ago. \\n\\nFord Credit Segment \\n \\n Ford Credit files periodic reports with the SEC that contain additional information regarding Ford Credit. The reports are available through Ford Credit s website located at www.ford.com/finance/investor-center and can also be found on the SEC s website located at www.sec.gov .

The first quarter 2024 U.S. loss-to-receivables LTR ratio of 47 basis points increased from a year ago, but remained low by historical standards. U.S. auction values in the first quarter of 2024 were lower compared to a year ago. \\n \\n Ford Credit s first quarter 2024 EBT of 326 million was 23 million higher than a year ago, explained primarily by higher financing margin and favorable volume and mix, offset partially by unfavorable lease residual performance. \\n 40 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Definitions and Information Regarding Ford Credit Causal Factors \\n \\n In general, we measure year-over-year changes in Ford Credit s EBT using the causal factors listed below: \\n \\n Volume and Mix: \\n Volume primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by changes in average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses at prior period financing margin yield (defined below in financing margin) at prior period exchange rates. Volume changes are primarily driven by the volume of new and used vehicles sold and leased, the extent to which Ford Credit purchases retail financing and operating lease contracts, the extent to which Ford Credit provides wholesale financing, the sales price of the vehicles financed, the level of dealer inventories, Ford-sponsored special financing programs available exclusively through Ford Credit, and the availability of cost-effective funding \\n Mix primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by period-over-period changes in the composition of Ford Credit s average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses by product within each region \\n \\n Financing Margin: \\n Financing margin variance is the period-over-period change in financing margin yield multiplied by the present period average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses at prior period exchange rates. This calculation is performed at the product and country level and then aggregated. Financing margin yield equals revenue, less interest expense and scheduled depreciation for the period, divided by average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses for the same period \\n Financing margin changes are driven by changes in revenue and interest expense. Changes in revenue are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, cost assumptions in pricing, mix of business, and competitive environment. Changes in interest expense are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, borrowing spreads, and asset-liability management \\n \\n Credit Loss: \\n Credit loss is the change in the provision for credit losses at prior period exchange rates. For analysis purposes, management splits the provision for credit losses into net charge-offs and the change in the allowance for credit losses \\n Net charge-off changes are primarily driven by the number of repossessions, severity per repossession, and recoveries. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are primarily driven by changes in historical trends in credit losses and recoveries, changes in the composition and size of Ford Credit s present portfolio, changes in trends in historical used vehicle values, and changes in forward looking macroeconomic conditions. For additional information, refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates - Allowance for Credit Losses section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2023 Form 10-K Report \\n \\n Lease Residual: \\n Lease residual measures changes to residual performance at prior period exchange rates. For analysis purposes, management splits residual performance primarily into residual gains and losses, and the change in accumulated supplemental depreciation \\n Residual gain and loss changes are primarily driven by the number of vehicles returned to Ford Credit and sold, and the difference between the auction value and the depreciated value (which includes both base and accumulated supplemental depreciation) of the vehicles sold. Changes in accumulated supplemental depreciation are primarily driven by changes in Ford Credit s estimate of the expected auction value at the end of the lease term and changes in Ford Credit s estimate of the number of vehicles that will be returned to it and sold. Depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases includes early termination losses on operating leases due to customer default events. For additional information, refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates - Accumulated Depreciation on Vehicles Subject to Operating Leases section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2023 Form 10-K Report \\n \\n Exchange: \\n Reflects changes in EBT driven by the effects of converting functional currency income to U.S. dollars \\n \\n Other: \\n Primarily includes operating expenses, other revenue, insurance expenses, and other income/(loss) at prior period exchange rates \\n Changes in operating expenses are primarily driven by salaried personnel costs, facilities costs, and costs associated with the origination and servicing of customer contracts \\n In general, other income/(loss) changes are primarily driven by changes in earnings related to market valuation adjustments to derivatives (primarily related to movements in interest rates) and other miscellaneous items \\n 41 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n In addition, the following definitions and calculations apply to Ford Credit when used in this Report: \\n \\n Cash (as shown in the Funding Structure and Liquidity tables) Cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash, excluding amounts related to insurance activities \\n \\n Debt (as shown in the Key Metrics and Leverage tables) Debt on Ford Credit s balance sheets. Includes debt issued in securitizations and payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets and related enhancements. Ford Credit holds the right to receive the excess cash flows not needed to pay the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions \\n \\n Earnings Before Taxes EBT Reflects Ford Credit s income before income taxes \\n \\n Loss-to-Receivables LTR Ratio LTR ratio is calculated using net charge-offs divided by average finance receivables, excluding unearned interest supplements and the allowance for credit losses \\n \\n Return on Equity ROE (as shown in the Key Metrics table) Reflects return on equity calculated by annualizing net income for the period and dividing by monthly average equity for the period \\n \\n Securitization and Restricted Cash (as shown in the Liquidity table) Securitization cash is held for the benefit of the securitization investors (for example, a reserve fund). Restricted cash primarily includes cash held to meet certain local governmental and regulatory reserve requirements and cash held under the terms of certain contractual agreements \\n \\n Securitizations (as shown in the Public Term Funding Plan table) Public securitization transactions, Rule 144A offerings sponsored by Ford Credit, and widely distributed offerings by Ford Credit Canada \\n \\n Term Asset-Backed Securities ABS (as shown in the Funding Structure table) Obligations issued in securitization transactions that are payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets and related enhancements \\n \\n Total Net Receivables (as shown in the Key Metrics table) Includes finance receivables (retail financing and wholesale) sold for legal purposes and net investment in operating leases included in securitization transactions that do not satisfy the requirements for accounting sale treatment. These receivables and operating leases are reported on Ford Credit s balance sheets and are available only for payment of the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions; they are not available to pay the other obligations of Ford Credit or the claims of Ford Credit s other creditors \\n\\n42 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Corporate Other \\n \\n Corporate Other primarily includes corporate governance expenses, past service pension and OPEB income and expense, interest income (excluding Ford Credit interest income and interest earned on our extended service contract portfolio) and gains and losses from our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding gains and losses on investments in equity securities), and foreign exchange derivatives gains and losses associated with intercompany lending. Corporate governance expenses are primarily administrative, delivering benefit on behalf of the global enterprise, that are not allocated to operating segments. These include expenses related to setting and directing global policy, providing oversight and stewardship, and promoting the Company s interests. In the first quarter of 2024, Corporate Other had a 147 million EBIT loss, unchanged from a year ago. \\n\\nInterest on Debt \\n \\n Interest on Debt, which consists of interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit, was 278 million in the first quarter of 2024, 30 million lower than a year ago. \\n\\nTaxes \\n \\n Our Provision for/(Benefit from) income taxes for the first quarter of 2024 was a provision of 278 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 17.2 . \\n \\n Our first quarter 2024 adjusted effective tax rate, which excludes special items, was 20.0 . \\n \\n We regularly review our organizational structure and income tax elections for affiliates in non-U.S. and U.S. tax jurisdictions, which may result in changes in affiliates that are included in or excluded from our U.S. tax return. Any future changes to our structure, as well as any changes in income tax laws in the countries that we operate, could cause increases or decreases to our deferred tax balances and related valuation allowances. \\n 43 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \\n \\n At March 31, 2024, total balance sheet cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash, including Ford Credit and entities held for sale, was 34.7 billion. \\n \\n We consider our key balance sheet metrics to be: (i) Company cash, which includes cash equivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash, including cash held for sale, excluding Ford Credit s cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash; and (ii) Company liquidity, which includes Company cash, less restricted cash, and total available committed credit lines, excluding Ford Credit s total available committed credit lines. \\n \\n Company excluding Ford Credit \\n December 31, 2023 March 31, 2024 Balance Sheets B) \\n Company Cash 28.8 25.1 Liquidity 46.4 42.6 Debt (19.9) (20.2) Cash Net of Debt 8.9 4.9 Pension Funded Status B) (a) \\n Funded Plans 2.1 2.6 Unfunded Plans (4.4) (4.3) Total Global Pension (2.3) (1.7) Total Funded Status OPEB (4.7) (4.6) \\n __________ \\n (a) Balances at March 31, 2024 reflect net funded status at December 31, 2023, updated for service and interest cost; expected return on assets; curtailments, settlements, and associated interim remeasurement (where applicable); separation expense; actual benefit payments; and cash contributions. The discount rate and rate of expected return assumptions are unchanged from year-end 2023. \\n \\n Liquidity . Our key priority is to maintain a strong balance sheet to withstand potential stress scenarios, while having resources available to invest in and grow our business. At March 31, 2024, we had Company cash of 25.1 billion and liquidity of 42.6 billion. At March 31, 2024, about 86 of Company cash was held by consolidated entities domiciled in the United States. \\n \\n To be prepared for an economic downturn and other stress scenarios, we target an ongoing Company cash balance at or above 20 billion plus significant additional liquidity above our Company cash target. We expect to have periods when we will be above or below this amount due to: (i) future cash flow expectations, such as for investments in future opportunities, capital investments, debt maturities, pension contributions, or restructuring requirements, (ii) short-term timing differences, and (iii) changes in the global economic or operating environment. \\n \\n Our Company cash investments primarily include U.S. Department of Treasury obligations, federal agency securities, bank time deposits with investment-grade institutions, investment-grade corporate securities, investment-grade commercial paper, and debt obligations of a select group of non-U.S. governments, non-U.S. governmental agencies, and supranational institutions. The average maturity of these investments is approximately one year and adjusted based on market conditions and liquidity needs. We monitor our Company cash levels and average maturity on a daily basis. \\n 44 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Material Cash Requirements. Our material cash requirements include: \\n \\n Capital expenditures (for additional information, see the Changes in Company Cash section below) and other payments for engineering, software, product development, and implementation of our plans for electric vehicles \\n \\n Purchase of raw materials and components to support the manufacturing and sale of vehicles (including electric vehicles), parts, and accessories (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table and the accompanying description of our Purchase obligations in the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Company Excluding Ford Credit section in Item 7 of our 2023 Form 10-K Report) \\n \\n Marketing incentive payments to dealers \\n \\n Payments for warranty and field service actions (for additional information, see Note 18 of the Notes to the Financial Statements herein) \\n \\n Debt repayments (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table in the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Company Excluding Ford Credit section in Item 7 and Note 19 of the Notes the Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K Report) \\n \\n Discretionary and mandatory payments to our global pension plans (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table in the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Company Excluding Ford Credit section in Item 7 of our 2023 Form 10-K Report, the Changes in Company Cash section below, and Note 11 of the Notes to the Financial Statements herein) \\n \\n Employee wages, benefits, and incentives \\n \\n Operating lease payments (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table in the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Company Excluding Ford Credit section in Item 7 and Note 18 of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K Report) \\n \\n Cash effects related to the restructuring of our business \\n \\n Strategic acquisitions and investments to grow our business, including electrification \\n \\n Subject to approval by our Board of Directors, shareholder distributions in the form of dividend payments and/or a share repurchase program (including share repurchases to offset the anti-dilutive effect of increased share-based compensation) may require the expenditure of a material amount of cash. We target shareholder distributions of 40 to 50 of adjusted free cash flow. Moreover, we may be subject to additional material cash requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, e.g., legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions, and other matters. \\n \\n We plan to utilize our liquidity (as described above) and our cash flows from business operations to fund our material cash requirements. \\n\\n45 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Changes in Company Cash. In managing our business, we classify changes in Company cash into operating and non-operating items. Operating items include: Company adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit EBT, capital spending, depreciation and tooling amortization, changes in working capital, Ford Credit distributions, interest on debt, cash taxes, and all other and timing differences (including timing differences between accrual-based EBIT and associated cash flows). Non-operating items include: restructuring costs, changes in Company debt excluding Ford Credit, contributions to funded pension plans, shareholder distributions, and other items (including gains and losses on investments in equity securities, acquisitions and divestitures, equity investments, and other transactions with Ford Credit). \\n \\n With respect to Changes in working capital, in general, the Company excluding Ford Credit carries relatively low trade receivables compared with our trade payables because the majority of our wholesales are financed (primarily by Ford Credit) immediately upon the sale of vehicles to dealers, which generally occurs shortly after being produced. In contrast, our trade payables are based primarily on industry-standard production supplier payment terms of about 45 days. As a result, our cash flow deteriorates if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) decrease while trade payables continue to become due. Conversely, our cash flow improves if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) increase while new trade payables are generally not due for about 45 days. For example, the suspension of production at most of our assembly plants and lower industry volumes due to COVID-19 in early 2020 resulted in an initial deterioration of our cash flow, while the subsequent resumption of manufacturing operations and return to pre-COVID-19 production levels at most of our assembly plants resulted in a subsequent improvement of our cash flow. Even in normal economic conditions, however, these working capital balances generally are subject to seasonal changes that can impact cash flow. For example, we typically experience cash flow timing differences associated with inventories and payables due to our annual shutdown periods when production, and therefore inventories and wholesale volumes, are usually at their lowest levels, while payables continue to come due and be paid. The net impact of this typically results in cash outflows from changes in our working capital balances during these shutdown periods. \\n \\n Our finished product inventory at March 31, 2024 was higher than at December 31, 2023, primarily reflecting new vehicle launches and units awaiting final quality review. \\n \\n In response to, or in anticipation of, supplier disruptions, we may stockpile certain components or raw materials to help prevent disruption in our production of vehicles. Such actions could have a short-term adverse impact on our cash and increase our inventory. Moreover, in order to secure critical materials for production of electric vehicles, we have entered into and we may, in the future, enter into offtake agreements with raw material suppliers and make investments in certain raw material and battery suppliers, including contributing up to a maximum of 6.6 billion in capital to BlueOval SK, LLC over a five-year period ending in 2026. Our actual capital outlay could vary significantly based on the final project costs and potential financing opportunities. Such investments could have an additional adverse impact on our cash in the near-term. \\n \\n The terms of the offtake agreements we have entered into, and those we may enter into in the future, vary by transaction, though they generally obligate us to purchase a certain percentage or minimum amount of output produced by the counterparty over an agreed upon period of time. The purchase price mechanism included in the offtake agreement is typically based on the market price of the material at the time of delivery. The terms may also include conditions to our obligation to purchase the materials, such as quality or minimum output. Subject to satisfaction of those conditions, we will be obligated to purchase the materials at the cost determined by the purchase price mechanism. As of March 31, 2024, our estimated expenditures for the maximum quantity that we are committed to purchase under these offtake agreements through 2035, subject to certain conditions, consist of approximately 3.9 billion of purchase obligations and approximately 6.9 billion of contingent purchase obligations based on our present forecast; however, our forecast could fluctuate from period to period based on market prices, which could result in significant increases or decreases in our estimate. The actual price paid for these materials will be recorded on our balance sheet at the time of purchase. In addition, as market conditions dictate, we may enter into additional offtake agreements with raw material suppliers or seek to renegotiate existing agreements. Based on the offtake agreements we have entered into thus far, the earliest date by which we could be obligated to purchase any output, subject to satisfaction of the applicable conditions, will be in the second half of 2024. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K Report and as updated by our subsequent filings with the SEC for a discussion of the risks related to our offtake agreements and other long-term purchase contracts. \\n\\n46 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Financial institutions participate in a supply chain finance SCF program that enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their Ford receivables (i.e., our payment obligations to the suppliers) to the financial institutions on a non-recourse basis in order to be paid earlier than our payment terms provide. Our suppliers voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms, the amounts we pay, or our liquidity. We have no economic interest in a supplier s decision to participate in the SCF program, and we do not provide any guarantees in connection with it. As of March 31, 2024, the outstanding amount of Ford receivables that suppliers elected to sell to the SCF financial institutions was 213 million. The amount settled through the SCF program during the first quarter of 2024 was 383 million. \\n \\n Changes in Company cash excluding Ford Credit are summarized below (in billions): \\n First Quarter 2023 2024 Company Excluding Ford Credit Company Adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit (a) 3.1 2.4 Capital spending (1.8) (2.1) Depreciation and tooling amortization 1.3 1.3 Net spending (0.5) (0.8) Receivables 0.4 Inventory (2.0) (3.1) Trade Payables 0.3 1.9 Changes in working capital (1.2) (1.2) Ford Credit distributions Interest on debt and cash taxes (0.6) (0.7) All other and timing differences (0.1) (0.2) Company adjusted free cash flow (a) 0.7 (0.5) Restructuring (0.2) Changes in debt (0.2) 0.2 Funded pension contributions (0.1) (0.5) Shareholder distributions (3.2) (1.3) All other (0.7) (1.4) Change in cash (3.6) (3.8) \\n __________ \\n (a) See Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations section for reconciliation to GAAP. \\n Note: Numbers may not sum due to rounding. \\n \\n Our first quarter 2024 Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities was positive 1.4 billion, 1.4 billion lower than a year ago (see page 60 for additional information). The decrease reflects higher inventory and lower net income, offset partially by higher accounts payable as reflected on our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Company adjusted free cash flow was negative 0.5 billion, 1.2 billion lower than a year ago. The decrease was primarily driven by lower Company adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit and higher capital spending. \\n \\n Capital spending was 2.1 billion in the first quarter of 2024, an increase of 0.3 billion from a year ago. We now expect full year 2024 capital spending to be in the range of 8 billion to 9 billion. \\n \\n First quarter 2024 working capital impact was 1.2 billion negative, driven by higher inventory, offset partially by higher trade payables, each compared to December 31, 2023. All other and timing differences were negative 0.2 billion. Timing differences include differences between accrual-based EBIT and the associated cash flows (e.g., marketing incentive and warranty payments to dealers, JV equity income, compensation payments, and pension and OPEB income or expense). \\n \\n In the first quarter of 2024, we contributed 550 million to our global funded pension plans. We continue to expect to contribute about 1 billion to our global funded pension plans in 2024. \\n \\n Shareholder distributions were 1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2024, all of which was attributable to our regular and supplemental dividend. \\n 47 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Available Credit Lines . Total Company committed credit lines, excluding Ford Credit, at March 31, 2024 were 19.4 billion, consisting of 13.5 billion of our corporate credit facility, 2.0 billion of our supplemental revolving credit facility, 1.8 billion of our 364-day revolving credit facility, and 2.2 billion of local credit facilities. At March 31, 2024, the utilized portion of the corporate credit facility was 18 million, representing amounts utilized for letters of credit. In addition, 1.7 billion of committed Company credit lines, excluding Ford Credit, was utilized under local credit facilities for our affiliates as of March 31, 2024. \\n \\n Our corporate, supplemental, and 364-day revolving credit facilities were amended as of April 22, 2024 to extend the maturity dates of the commitments under each facility and increase the size of our 364-day revolving credit facility. Following the corporate credit facility amendment, 25 million of commitments mature on April 26, 2026, 3.4 billion of commitments mature on April 22, 2027, 0.1 billion of commitments mature on April 26, 2028, and 10.0 billion of commitments mature on April 20, 2029. Following the supplemental revolving credit facility amendment, 2.0 billion of commitments mature on April 22, 2027. Following the 364-day revolving credit facility amendment, 2.5 billion of commitments mature on April 21, 2025. \\n \\n The corporate, supplemental, and 364-day credit agreements include certain sustainability-linked targets, pursuant to which the applicable margin and facility fees may be adjusted if Ford achieves, or fails to achieve, the specified targets related to global manufacturing facility greenhouse gas emissions, carbon-free electricity consumption, and Ford Europe CO 2 tailpipe emissions. \\n \\n The corporate credit facility is unsecured and free of material adverse change conditions to borrowing, restrictive financial covenants (for example, interest or fixed-charge coverage ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and minimum net worth requirements), and credit rating triggers that could limit our ability to obtain funding or trigger early repayment. The corporate credit facility contains a liquidity covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum of 4 billion in aggregate of domestic cash, cash equivalents, and loaned and marketable securities and/or availability under the corporate credit facility, supplemental revolving credit facility, and 364-day revolving credit facility. If our senior, unsecured, long-term debt does not maintain at least two investment grade ratings from Fitch, Moody s, and S P, the guarantees of certain subsidiaries will be required. The terms and conditions of the supplemental and 364-day revolving credit facilities are consistent with our corporate credit facility. Ford Credit has been designated as a subsidiary borrower under the corporate credit facility and the 364-day revolving credit facility. \\n \\n Debt. As shown in Note 12 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, at March 31, 2024, Company debt excluding Ford Credit was 20.2 billion. This balance is 0.2 billion higher than at December 31, 2023. \\n \\n Leverage. We manage Company debt (excluding Ford Credit) levels with a leverage framework that targets investment grade credit ratings through a normal business cycle. The leverage framework includes a ratio of total Company debt (excluding Ford Credit), underfunded pension liabilities, operating leases, and other adjustments, divided by Company adjusted EBIT (excluding Ford Credit EBT), and further adjusted to exclude depreciation and tooling amortization (excluding Ford Credit). \\n \\n Ford Credit s leverage is calculated as a separate business as described in the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Ford Credit Segment section of Item 2. Ford Credit is self-funding and its debt, which is used to fund its operations, is separate from our Company debt excluding Ford Credit. \\n 48 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Ford Credit Segment \\n \\n Ford Credit remains well capitalized with a strong balance sheet and funding diversified across platforms and markets. Ford Credit ended the first quarter of 2024 with 27.0 billion of liquidity, up 1.3 billion from year-end. Ford Credit continues to have robust access to capital markets, completing 13 billion of public term issuances through April 23, 2024. \\n \\n Key elements of Ford Credit s funding strategy include: \\n \\n Maintain strong liquidity and funding diversity \\n Prudently access public markets \\n Continue to leverage retail deposit funding in Europe \\n Flexibility to increase ABS mix as needed; preserving assets and committed capacity \\n Target financial statement leverage of 9:1 to 10:1 \\n Maintain self-liquidating balance sheet \\n \\n Ford Credit s liquidity profile continues to be diverse, robust, and focused on maintaining liquidity levels that meet its business and funding requirements. Ford Credit regularly stress tests its balance sheet and liquidity to ensure that it can continue to meet its financial obligations through economic cycles. \\n \\n The following table shows funding for Ford Credit s net receivables (in billions): \\n March 31, 2023 December 31, 2023 March 31, 2024 Funding Structure Term unsecured debt 49.3 54.1 57.0 Term asset-backed securities 55.0 58.0 54.9 Retail Deposits / Ford Interest Advantage 15.3 17.2 17.4 Other 2.3 1.4 1.6 Equity 12.2 13.4 13.5 Adjustments for cash (10.3) (10.9) (8.9) Total Net Receivables 123.8 133.2 135.5 Securitized Funding as Percent of Total Debt 46.0 44.9 42.5 \\n \\n Net receivables of 135.5 billion at March 31, 2024 were funded primarily with term unsecured debt and term asset-backed securities. Securitized funding as a percent of total debt was 42.5 as of March 31, 2024. \\n \\n Public Term Funding Plan. The following table shows Ford Credit s issuances for full year 2022 and 2023, planned issuances for full year 2024, and its global public term funding issuances through April 23, 2024, excluding short-term funding programs (in billions): \\n 2022 Actual 2023 Actual 2024 Forecast Through April 23 Unsecured 6 14 14-17 8 Securitizations (a) 10 14 13-16 5 Total public 16 28 27-33 13 \\n __________ \\n (a) See Definitions and Information Regarding Ford Credit Causal Factors section. \\n \\n For 2024, Ford Credit continues to project full year public term funding in the range of 27 billion to 33 billion. \\n 49 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Liquidity. The following table shows Ford Credit s liquidity sources and utilization (in billions): \\n March 31, 2023 December 31, 2023 March 31, 2024 Liquidity Sources (a) \\n Cash 10.3 10.9 8.9 Committed asset-backed facilities 40.5 42.9 42.6 Other unsecured credit facilities 2.5 2.4 2.3 Total liquidity sources 53.3 56.2 53.8 Utilization of Liquidity (a) \\n Securitization and restricted cash (3.0) (2.8) (3.4) Committed asset-backed facilities (24.0) (27.5) (23.3) Other unsecured credit facilities (0.4) (0.4) (0.4) Total utilization of liquidity (27.4) (30.7) (27.1) Available Liquidity 25.9 25.5 26.7 Other adjustments 0.2 0.2 0.3 Net liquidity available for use 26.1 25.7 27.0 \\n __________ \\n (a) See Definitions and Information Regarding Ford Credit Causal Factors section. \\n \\n Ford Credit s net liquidity available for use will fluctuate quarterly based on factors including near-term debt maturities, receivable growth and decline, and timing of funding transactions. At March 31, 2024, Ford Credit s net liquidity available for use was 27.0 billion, 1.3 billion higher than year-end 2023, reflecting strong access to public funding markets. At March 31, 2024, Ford Credit s liquidity sources, including cash, committed asset-backed facilities, and unsecured credit facilities, totaled 53.8 billion, down 2.4 billion from year-end 2023. \\n \\n Material Cash Requirements. Ford Credit s material cash requirements include: (1) the purchase of retail financing and operating lease contracts from dealers and providing wholesale financing for dealers to finance new and used vehicles; and (2) debt repayments (for additional information on debt, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table in the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Company Excluding Ford Credit section in Item 7 and Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K Report). In addition, subject to approval by Ford Credit s Board of Directors, shareholder distributions may require the expenditure of a material amount of cash. Moreover, Ford Credit may be subject to additional material cash requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, e.g., legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions, and other matters. \\n \\n Ford Credit plans to utilize its liquidity (as described above) and its cash flows from business operations to fund its material cash requirements. \\n \\n Funding and Liquidity Risks. Ford Credit s funding plan is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control, including disruption in the capital markets, that could impact both unsecured debt and asset-backed securities issuance and the effects of regulatory changes on the financial markets. Refer to the Liquidity - Ford Credit Segment - Funding and Liquidity Risks section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2023 Form 10-K Report for more information. \\n \\n 50 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Leverage. Ford Credit uses leverage, or the debt-to-equity ratio, to make various business decisions, including evaluating and establishing pricing for finance receivable and operating lease financing, and assessing its capital structure. \\n \\n The table below shows the calculation of Ford Credit s financial statement leverage (in billions): \\n March 31, 2023 December 31, 2023 March 31, 2024 Leverage Calculation Debt 119.6 129.3 129.3 Equity (a) 12.2 13.4 13.5 Financial statement leverage (to 1) 9.8 9.7 9.6 \\n __________ \\n (a) Total shareholder s interest reported on Ford Credit s balance sheets. \\n \\n Ford Credit plans its leverage by considering market conditions and the risk characteristics of its business. At March 31, 2024, Ford Credit s financial statement leverage was 9.6:1. Ford Credit targets financial statement leverage in the range of 9:1 to 10:1. \\n \\n 51 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Total Company \\n \\n Pension Plans - Funded Balances. As of March 31, 2024, our total Company pension underfunded status reported on our consolidated balance sheets was 1.7 billion and reflects the net funded status at December 31, 2023, updated for: service and interest cost; expected return on assets; curtailments, settlements, and associated interim remeasurement (where applicable); separation expense; actual benefit payments; and cash contributions. For plans without interim remeasurement, the discount rate and rate of expected return assumptions are unchanged from year-end 2023. \\n \\n Return on Invested Capital ROIC ). We analyze total Company performance using an adjusted ROIC financial metric based on an after-tax, rolling four-quarter average. The following table contains the calculation of our ROIC for the periods shown (in billions): \\n Four Quarters Ending March 31, 2023 March 31, 2024 Adjusted Net Operating Profit/(Loss) After Cash Tax Net income/(loss) attributable to Ford 2.9 3.9 Add: Noncontrolling interest (0.3) 0.1 Less: Income tax (0.4) 0.6 Add: Cash tax (0.9) (1.2) Less: Interest on debt (1.3) (1.3) Less: Total pension/OPEB income/(cost) (0.1) (2.9) Add: Pension/OPEB service costs (0.9) (0.6) Net operating profit/(loss) after cash tax 2.6 5.8 Less: Special items (excl. pension/OPEB) pre-tax (6.6) (2.9) Adjusted net operating profit/(loss) after cash tax 9.2 8.7 Invested Capital Equity 42.2 42.9 Debt (excl.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n CREDIT RATINGS \\n \\n Our short-term and long-term debt is rated by four credit rating agencies designated as nationally recognized statistical rating organizations NRSROs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission: DBRS, Fitch, Moody s, and S P. \\n \\n In several markets, locally recognized rating agencies also rate us. A credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the credit risk associated with a corporate entity or particular securities issued by that entity. Rating agencies ratings of us are based on information provided by us and other sources. Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria for evaluating company risk and, therefore, ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. \\n \\n There have been no rating actions taken by these NRSROs since the filing of our 2023 Form 10-K Report. \\n \\n The following table summarizes certain of the credit ratings and outlook presently assigned by these four NRSROs: \\n NRSRO RATINGS Ford Ford Credit NRSROs Issuer Default / Corporate / Issuer Rating Long-Term Senior Unsecured Outlook / Trend Long-Term Senior Unsecured Short-Term Unsecured Outlook / Trend Minimum Long-Term Investment Grade Rating DBRS BBB (low) BBB (low) Stable BBB (low) R-2 (low) Stable BBB (low) Fitch BBB- BBB- Stable BBB- F3 Stable BBB- Moody s N/A Ba1 Stable Ba1 NP Stable Baa3 S P BBB- BBB- Stable BBB- A-3 Stable BBB- \\n \\n 53 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n OUTLOOK \\n \\n We provided 2024 Company guidance in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K dated April 24, 2024. The guidance is based on our expectations as of April 24, 2024, and assumes no material change to our current assumptions for inflation, logistics issues, production, or macroeconomic conditions. Our actual results could differ materially from our guidance due to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including those set forth in Risk Factors in Item 1A of our 2023 Form 10-K Report and as updated by our subsequent filings with the SEC. \\n \\n 2024 Guidance Total Company Adjusted EBIT (a) 10 - 12 billion Adjusted Free Cash Flow (a) 6.5 - 7.5 billion Capital spending 8 - 9 billion Ford Credit EBT About 1.5 billion \\n __________ \\n (a) When we provide guidance for Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted Free Cash Flow, we do not provide guidance for the most comparable GAAP measures because, as described in more detail below in Non-GAAP Measures That Supplement GAAP Measures, they include items that are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty. \\n\\nFor full-year 2024, we expect adjusted EBIT of 10 billion to 12 billion and adjusted free cash flow of 6.5 billion to 7.5 billion. \\n \\n On a segment basis, we expect: \\n \\n Ford Pro EBIT of 8 billion to 9 billion driven by continued growth and favorable mix, offset partially by moderated pricing \\n Ford Blue EBIT of 7 billion to 7.5 billion, reflecting a balanced market equation and cost efficiencies offsetting higher labor and product costs \\n Ford Model e EBIT loss of 5 billion to 5.5 billion, driven by continued pricing pressure and investments in new vehicles \\n Ford Credit EBT of about 1.5 billion \\n \\n Our outlook for 2024 assumes: \\n \\n Flat to modest U.S. industry growth at 16 million to 16.5 million \\n Full year of all-new Super Duty, which drives positive pricing and mix in Ford Pro \\n Lower industry pricing \\n 2 billion of cost reductions in material, freight, and manufacturing \\n \\n 54 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements \\n \\n Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations, forecasts, and assumptions by our management and involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: \\n \\n Ford is highly dependent on its suppliers to deliver components in accordance with Ford s production schedule and specifications, and a shortage of or inability to acquire key components or raw materials, such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, can disrupt Ford s production of vehicles; \\n To facilitate access to the raw materials and other components necessary for the production of electric vehicles, Ford has entered into and may, in the future, enter into multi-year commitments to raw material and other suppliers that subject Ford to risks associated with lower future demand for such items as well as costs that fluctuate and are difficult to accurately forecast; \\n Ford s long-term competitiveness depends on the successful execution of Ford+; \\n Ford s vehicles could be affected by defects that result in recall campaigns, increased warranty costs, or delays in new model launches, and the time it takes to improve the quality of our vehicles and services could continue to have an adverse effect on our business; \\n Ford may not realize the anticipated benefits of existing or pending strategic alliances, joint ventures, acquisitions, divestitures, or business strategies; \\n Ford may not realize the anticipated benefits of restructuring actions and such actions may cause Ford to incur significant charges, disrupt our operations, or harm our reputation; \\n Operational information systems, security systems, vehicles, and services could be affected by cybersecurity incidents, ransomware attacks, and other disruptions and impact Ford and Ford Credit as well as their suppliers and dealers; \\n Ford s production, as well as Ford s suppliers production, and/or the ability to deliver products to consumers could be disrupted by labor issues, public health issues, natural or man-made disasters, adverse effects of climate change, financial distress, production difficulties, capacity limitations, or other factors; \\n Failure to develop and deploy secure digital services that appeal to customers could have a negative impact on Ford s business; \\n Ford s ability to maintain a competitive cost structure could be affected by labor or other constraints; \\n Ford s ability to attract, develop, grow, and reward talent is critical to its success and competitiveness; \\n Ford s new and existing products and digital, software, and physical services are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries, and its reputation may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced; \\n Ford s results are dependent on sales of larger, more profitable vehicles, particularly in the United States; \\n With a global footprint and supply chain, Ford s results and operations could be adversely affected by economic or geopolitical developments, including protectionist trade policies such as tariffs, or other events; \\n Industry sales volume can be volatile and could decline if there is a financial crisis, recession, public health emergency, or significant geopolitical event; \\n Ford may face increased price competition or a reduction in demand for its products resulting from industry excess capacity, currency fluctuations, competitive actions, or other factors, particularly for electric vehicles; \\n Inflationary pressure and fluctuations in commodity and energy prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and market value of Ford or Ford Credit s investments, including marketable securities, can have a significant effect on results; \\n Ford and Ford Credit s access to debt, securitization, or derivative markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts could be affected by credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, regulatory requirements, or other factors; \\n The impact of government incentives on Ford s business could be significant, and Ford s receipt of government incentives could be subject to reduction, termination, or clawback; \\n Ford Credit could experience higher-than-expected credit losses, lower-than-anticipated residual values, or higher-than-expected return volumes for leased vehicles; \\n Economic and demographic experience for pension and OPEB plans (e.g., discount rates or investment returns) could be worse than Ford has assumed; \\n Pension and other postretirement liabilities could adversely affect Ford s liquidity and financial condition; \\n Ford and Ford Credit could experience unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations, or adverse publicity arising out of alleged defects in products, services, perceived environmental impacts, or otherwise; \\n Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations; \\n Ford and Ford Credit could be affected by the continued development of more stringent privacy, data use, data protection, and artificial intelligence laws and regulations as well as consumers heightened expectations to safeguard their personal information; and \\n Ford Credit could be subject to new or increased credit regulations, consumer protection regulations, or other regulations. \\n 55 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n We cannot be certain that any expectation, forecast, or assumption made in preparing forward-looking statements will prove accurate, or that any projection will be realized. It is to be expected that there may be differences between projected and actual results. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of their initial issuance, and we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. For additional discussion, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K Report, as updated by our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. \\n 56 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT SUPPLEMENT GAAP MEASURES \\n \\n We use both generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for operational and financial decision making, and to assess Company and segment business performance. The non-GAAP measures listed below are intended to be considered by users as supplemental information to their equivalent GAAP measures, to aid investors in better understanding our financial results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful perspective on underlying operating results and trends, and a means to compare our period-over-period results. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in items or events being adjusted. \\n \\n Company Adjusted EBIT (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Income/(Loss) Attributable to Ford) Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) excludes interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), taxes, and pre-tax special items. This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it focuses on underlying operating results and trends, and improves comparability of our period-over-period results. Our management ordinarily excludes special items from its review of the results of the operating segments for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources. Our categories of pre-tax special items and the applicable significance guideline for each item (which may consist of a group of items related to a single event or action) are as follows: \\n \\n Pre-Tax Special Item Significance Guideline Pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses No minimum Gains and losses on investments in equity securities No minimum Personnel expenses, supplier- and dealer-related costs, and facility-related charges stemming from our efforts to match production capacity and cost structure to market demand and changing model mix Generally 100 million or more Other items that we do not necessarily consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities 500 million or more for individual field service actions; generally 100 million or more for other items \\n \\n When we provide guidance for adjusted EBIT, we do not provide guidance on a net income basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty, including gains and losses on pension and OPEB remeasurements and on investments in equity securities. \\n \\n Company Adjusted EBIT Margin (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Company Net Income/(Loss) Margin) Company Adjusted EBIT margin is Company adjusted EBIT divided by Company revenue. This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it allows users to evaluate our operating results aligned with industry reporting. \\n \\n Adjusted Earnings/(Loss) Per Share (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Earnings/(Loss) Per Share) Measure of Company s diluted net earnings/(loss) per share adjusted for impact of pre-tax special items (described above), tax special items, and restructuring impacts in noncontrolling interests. The measure provides investors with useful information to evaluate performance of our business excluding items not indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities. When we provide guidance for adjusted earnings/(loss) per share, we do not provide guidance on an earnings/(loss) per share basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses. \\n \\n Adjusted Effective Tax Rate (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Effective Tax Rate) Measure of Company s tax rate excluding pre-tax special items (described above) and tax special items. The measure provides an ongoing effective rate which investors find useful for historical comparisons and for forecasting. When we provide guidance for adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide guidance on an effective tax rate basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses. \\n 57 \\n\\nItem 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Company Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Cash Provided By/(Used In) Operating Activities) Measure of Company s operating cash flow excluding Ford Credit s operating cash flows. The measure contains elements management considers operating activities, including Company excluding Ford Credit capital spending, Ford Credit distributions to its parent, and settlement of derivatives. The measure excludes cash outflows for funded pension contributions, restructuring actions, and other items that are considered operating cash flows under U.S. GAAP. This measure is useful to management and investors because it is consistent with management s assessment of the Company s operating cash flow performance. When we provide guidance for Company adjusted free cash flow, we do not provide guidance for net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities because the GAAP measure will include items that are difficult to quantify or predict with reasonable certainty, including cash flows related to the Company's exposures to foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices (separate from any related hedges), Ford Credit's operating cash flows, and cash flows related to special items, including separation payments, each of which individually or in the aggregate could have a significant impact to our net cash provided by/(used in) our operating activities. \\n \\n Adjusted ROIC Calculated as the sum of adjusted net operating profit/(loss) after cash tax from the last four quarters, divided by the average invested capital over the last four quarters. Adjusted Return on Invested Capital Adjusted ROIC provides management and investors with useful information to evaluate the Company s after-cash tax operating return on its invested capital for the period presented.

As a result, we have incurred, and may continue to incur, expenses related to payments to our electric vehicle-related suppliers (battery, raw material, or otherwise), inventory adjustments, or other matters. Further, significant unexpected changes in the EV demand environment have led, and may in the future lead, to incremental competitive pricing actions. These market dynamics may continue to occur, which could have a substantial impact on our business. \n",

      " As a result, in the first quarter of 2024, we recorded about 0.4 billion of expenses and about 0.3 billion of adjustments related to revenue recognized in prior periods. In addition, slower-than-anticipated development of the electric vehicle market may impact our strategy to comply with regulatory standards, and, in some cases, we plan to utilize credits purchased from third parties to demonstrate regulatory compliance or we may need to modify our product offerings. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K Report and as updated by our subsequent filings with the SEC for a discussion of the risks related to lower-than-anticipated electric vehicle volumes and our planned transition to a greater mix of electric vehicles. \n",

      " Changes in Company Cash. In managing our business, we classify changes in Company cash into operating and non-operating items. Operating items include: Company adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit EBT, capital spending, depreciation and tooling amortization, changes in working capital, Ford Credit distributions, interest on debt, cash taxes, and all other and timing differences (including timing differences between accrual-based EBIT and associated cash flows). Non-operating items include: restructuring costs, changes in Company debt excluding Ford Credit, contributions to funded pension plans, shareholder distributions, and other items (including gains and losses on investments in equity securities, acquisitions and divestitures, equity investments, and other transactions with Ford Credit). \n",
      " \n",
      " With respect to Changes in working capital, in general, the Company excluding Ford Credit carries relatively low trade receivables compared with our trade payables because the majority of our wholesales are financed (primarily by Ford Credit) immediately upon the sale of vehicles to dealers, which generally occurs shortly after being produced. In contrast, our trade payables are based primarily on industry-standard production supplier payment terms of about 45 days. As a result, our cash flow deteriorates if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) decrease while trade payables continue to become due. Conversely, our cash flow improves if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) increase while new trade payables are generally not due for about 45 days. For example, the suspension of production at most of our assembly plants and lower industry volumes due to COVID-19 in early 2020 resulted in an initial deterioration of our cash flow, while the subsequent resumption of manufacturing operations and return to pre-COVID-19 production levels at most of our assembly plants resulted in a subsequent improvement of our cash flow. Even in normal economic conditions, however, these working capital balances generally are subject to seasonal changes that can impact cash flow. For example, we typically experience cash flow timing differences associated with inventories and payables due to our annual shutdown periods when production, and therefore inventories and wholesale volumes, are usually at their lowest levels, while payables continue to come due and be paid. The net impact of this typically results in cash outflows from changes in our working capital balances during these shutdown periods. \n",

      " In response to, or in anticipation of, supplier disruptions, we may stockpile certain components or raw materials to help prevent disruption in our production of vehicles. Such actions could have a short-term adverse impact on our cash and increase our inventory. Moreover, in order to secure critical materials for production of electric vehicles, we have entered into and we may, in the future, enter into offtake agreements with raw material suppliers and make investments in certain raw material and battery suppliers, including contributing up to a maximum of 6.6 billion in capital to BlueOval SK, LLC over a five-year period ending in 2026. Our actual capital outlay could vary significantly based on the final project costs and potential financing opportunities. Such investments could have an additional adverse impact on our cash in the near-term. \n",
      " \n",
      " The terms of the offtake agreements we have entered into, and those we may enter into in the future, vary by transaction, though they generally obligate us to purchase a certain percentage or minimum amount of output produced by the counterparty over an agreed upon period of time. The purchase price mechanism included in the offtake agreement is typically based on the market price of the material at the time of delivery. The terms may also include conditions to our obligation to purchase the materials, such as quality or minimum output. Subject to satisfaction of those conditions, we will be obligated to purchase the materials at the cost determined by the purchase price mechanism. As of March 31, 2024, our estimated expenditures for the maximum quantity that we are committed to purchase under these offtake agreements through 2035, subject to certain conditions, consist of approximately 3.9 billion of purchase obligations and approximately 6.9 billion of contingent purchase obligations based on our present forecast; however, our forecast could fluctuate from period to period based on market prices, which could result in significant increases or decreases in our estimate. The actual price paid for these materials will be recorded on our balance sheet at the time of purchase. In addition, as market conditions dictate, we may enter into additional offtake agreements with raw material suppliers or seek to renegotiate existing agreements.

      " \n",
      " We use both generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for operational and financial decision making, and to assess Company and segment business performance. The non-GAAP measures listed below are intended to be considered by users as supplemental information to their equivalent GAAP measures, to aid investors in better understanding our financial results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful perspective on underlying operating results and trends, and a means to compare our period-over-period results. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in items or events being adjusted. \n",
      " \n",
      " Company Adjusted EBIT (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Income/(Loss) Attributable to Ford) Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) excludes interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), taxes, and pre-tax special items. This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it focuses on underlying operating results and trends, and improves comparability of our period-over-period results. Our management ordinarily excludes special items from its review of the results of the operating segments for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources. Our categories of pre-tax special items and the applicable significance guideline for each item (which may consist of a group of items related to a single event or action) are as follows: \n",
      " \n",
      " Pre-Tax Special Item Significance Guideline Pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses No minimum Gains and losses on investments in equity securities No minimum Personnel expenses, supplier- and dealer-related costs, and facility-related charges stemming from our efforts to match production capacity and cost structure to market demand and changing model mix Generally 100 million or more Other items that we do not necessarily consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities 500 million or more for individual field service actions; generally 100 million or more for other items \n",
      " \n",
      " When we provide guidance for adjusted EBIT, we do not provide guidance on a net income basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty, including gains and losses on pension and OPEB remeasurements and on investments in equity securities. \n",
      " \n",
      " Company Adjusted EBIT Margin (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Company Net Income/(Loss) Margin) Company Adjusted EBIT margin is Company adjusted EBIT divided by Company revenue. This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it allows users to evaluate our operating results aligned with industry reporting. \n",
      " \n",
      " Adjusted Earnings/(Loss) Per Share (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Earnings/(Loss) Per Share) Measure of Company s diluted net earnings/(loss) per share adjusted for impact of pre-tax special items (described above), tax special items, and restructuring impacts in noncontrolling interests. The measure provides investors with useful information to evaluate performance of our business excluding items not indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities. When we provide guidance for adjusted earnings/(loss) per share, we do not provide guidance on an earnings/(loss) per share basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses. \n",

The measure provides an ongoing effective rate which investors find useful for historical comparisons and for forecasting. When we provide guidance for adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide guidance on an effective tax rate basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses. \n",

      " Company Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Cash Provided By/(Used In) Operating Activities) Measure of Company s operating cash flow excluding Ford Credit s operating cash flows. The measure contains elements management considers operating activities, including Company excluding Ford Credit capital spending, Ford Credit distributions to its parent, and settlement of derivatives. The measure excludes cash outflows for funded pension contributions, restructuring actions, and other items that are considered operating cash flows under U.S. GAAP. This measure is useful to management and investors because it is consistent with management s assessment of the Company s operating cash flow performance. When we provide guidance for Company adjusted free cash flow, we do not provide guidance for net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities because the GAAP measure will include items that are difficult to quantify or predict with reasonable certainty, including cash flows related to the Company's exposures to foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices (separate from any related hedges), Ford Credit's operating cash flows, and cash flows related to special items, including separation payments, each of which individually or in the aggregate could have a significant impact to our net cash provided by/(used in) our operating activities. \n",

Adjusted net operating profit/(loss) after cash tax measures operating results less special items, interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), and certain pension/OPEB costs.



                                                                                                                           ITEM 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \\n\\nKey Trends and Economic Factors Affecting Ford and the Automotive Industry \\n \\n Production and Supply Chain. Although we saw improvements in our supply chain throughout 2023, including easing of the semiconductor shortage, we continue to face some production issues due to, among other things, labor shortages at our suppliers. Moreover, we have received and continue to receive claims from our supply base related to inflationary pressure and production disruption. Upon receipt, we evaluate those claims, and, in certain circumstances, in order to ensure continuity of supply and mitigate the impact on our production, have made payments to our suppliers, sometimes under duress. We continue to reevaluate our supply base and sourcing decisions and may in the future incur charges to improve flexibility and cost competitiveness. \\n \\n Currency Exchange Rate Volatility. Globally, central banks have begun shifting from tightening policy by raising interest rates to holding rates steady or, in some markets, beginning to cut rates. As they do, they need to carefully balance the risk that inflation remains elevated against the heightened financial and economic risks associated with high interest rates. This is notable for many emerging markets, which may also face increased exposure to commodity prices and political instability, contributing to unpredictable movements in the value of their exchange rates. In addition to direct impacts on the financial flows of global automotive companies, currency movements can also impact pricing of vehicles exported to overseas markets. In most markets, exchange rates are market-determined, and all are impacted by many different macroeconomic and policy factors, and thus likely to remain volatile. However, in some markets, exchange rates are heavily influenced or controlled by governments. \\n \\n Pricing Pressure. Despite vehicle pricing remaining elevated over the last year due to strong demand, supply shortages, and inflationary costs, we have already observed moderation in the rate of new and used vehicle price increases as auto production recovers from the semiconductor shortage, but it is unclear whether prices will decline fully to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. Over the long term, intense competition and excess capacity are likely to put downward pressure on inflation-adjusted prices for similarly-contented vehicles and contribute to a challenging pricing environment for the automotive industry in most major markets. \\n \\n Electric Vehicle Market. Although we continue to invest in our electric vehicle strategy, we have observed lower-than-anticipated industrywide electric vehicle adoption rates and near-term pricing pressures, which has led us and may in the future lead us to adjust our spending, production, and/or product launches to better match the pace of electric vehicle adoption. As a result of the lower-than-anticipated adoption rates, near-term pricing pressures, and other factors, we recorded about 0.7 billion of charges in 2023 and may continue to incur charges, which could be substantial, related to payments to our electric vehicle-related suppliers (battery, raw material, or otherwise), inventory adjustments, or other matters. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional discussion of the risks related to lower-than-anticipated electric vehicle volumes and our planned transition to a greater mix of electric vehicles. \\n \\n Commodity and Energy Prices. Prices for commodities remain volatile. In some cases, spot prices for various commodities have recently diverged somewhat, as anticipated weakening in global industrial activity mitigates price increases for base metals such as steel and aluminum, while precious metals (e.g., palladium), and raw materials that are used in batteries for electric vehicles (e.g., lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, among other materials, for batteries) remain elevated. The net impact on us and our suppliers has been higher material costs overall. To help ensure supply of raw materials for critical components (e.g., batteries), we, like others in the industry, have entered into multi-year sourcing agreements and may enter into additional agreements. Similar dynamics are impacting energy markets, with Europe particularly exposed to the risk of both higher prices and constraints on supply of natural gas due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Such shortages may impact facilities operated by us or our suppliers, which could have an impact on us in Europe and other regions. In the long term, the outcome of de-carbonization and electrification of the vehicle fleet may depress oil demand, but the global energy transition will also contribute to ongoing volatility of oil and other energy prices. \\n \\n Vehicle Profitability. Our financial results depend on the profitability of the vehicles we sell, which may vary significantly by vehicle line. In general, larger vehicles tend to command higher prices and be more profitable than smaller vehicles. For example, in Ford Blue, our larger, more profitable vehicles had an average contribution margin that was 139 of our total average contribution margin across all vehicles, whereas our smaller vehicles had significantly lower contribution margins. In addition, government regulations aimed at reducing emissions and increasing fuel efficiency (e.g., ZEV mandates and low emission zones), and other factors that accelerate the transition to electrified vehicles, may increase the cost of vehicles by more than the perceived benefit to consumers and dampen margins. \\n\\n40 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Trade Policy. To the extent governments in various regions implement or intensify barriers to imports, such as erecting tariff or non-tariff barriers or manipulating their currency, and provide advantages to local exporters selling into the global marketplace, there can be a significant negative impact on manufacturers based in other markets. While we believe the long-term trend will support the growth of free trade, we will continue to monitor and address the developing role that geopolitical, climate, and labor concerns are playing in trade relations. \\n \\n Inflation and Interest Rates. We continue to see near-term impacts on our business due to inflation, including ongoing global price pressures in the wake of geopolitical volatility, driving up energy prices, freight premiums, and other operating costs above normal rates. Although headline inflation in the United States and Europe appears to have peaked, as gasoline and natural gas prices recede from the latest spike, core inflation (excluding food and energy prices) remains elevated and is a source of continued cost pressure on businesses and households. Interest rates have increased significantly as central banks in developed countries attempt to subdue inflation while government deficits and debt remain at high levels in many global markets. Accordingly, the eventual implications of higher government deficits and debt, tighter monetary policy, and potentially higher long-term interest rates may drive a higher cost of capital for the business. At Ford Credit, rising interest rates may impact its ability to source funding and offer financing at competitive rates, which could reduce its financing margin. \\n \\n Revenue \\n \\n Company excluding Ford Credit revenue is generated primarily by sales of vehicles, parts, accessories, and services from our Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro segments. Revenue is recorded when control is transferred to our customers (generally, our dealers and distributors). For the majority of sales, this occurs when products are shipped from our manufacturing facilities. However, we defer a portion of the consideration received when there is a separate future or stand-ready performance obligation, such as extended service contracts or ongoing vehicle connectivity. Revenue related to extended service contracts is recognized over the term of the agreement in proportion to the costs we expect to incur in satisfying the contract obligations; revenue related to other future or stand-ready performance obligations is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the period in which services are expected to be performed. Vehicles sold to daily rental car companies with an obligation to repurchase at an agreed upon amount, exercisable at the option of the customer, are accounted for as operating leases, with lease revenue recognized over the term of the lease. Proceeds from the sale of vehicles at auction are recognized in revenue upon transfer of control of the vehicle to the buyer. \\n \\n Most of the vehicles sold by us to our dealers and distributors are financed at wholesale by Ford Credit. Upon Ford Credit originating the wholesale receivable related to a dealer s purchase of a vehicle, Ford Credit pays cash to the relevant Ford entity in payment of the dealer s obligation for the purchase price of the vehicle. The dealer then pays the wholesale finance receivable to Ford Credit when it sells the vehicle to a retail customer. \\n \\n Our Ford Credit segment revenue is generated primarily from interest on finance receivables and revenue from operating leases. Revenue from interest on finance receivables is recognized over the term of the receivable using the interest method and includes the amortization of certain deferred origination costs. Revenue from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. \\n \\n Transactions between Ford Credit and our other segments occur in the ordinary course of business. For example, we offer special retail financing and lease incentives to dealers customers who choose to finance or lease our vehicles from Ford Credit. The cost for these incentives is included in our estimate of variable consideration at the date the related vehicle sales to our dealers are recorded. In order to compensate Ford Credit for the lower interest or lease payments offered to the retail customer, we pay the discounted value of the incentive directly to Ford Credit when it originates the retail finance or lease contract with the dealer s customer. Ford Credit recognizes the incentive amount over the life of retail finance contracts as an element of financing revenue and over the life of lease contracts as a reduction to depreciation. See Note 1 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of transactions between Ford Credit and our other segments. \\n\\n41 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Costs and Expenses \\n \\n Our income statement classifies our Company excluding Ford Credit total costs and expenses into two categories: (i) cost of sales, and (ii) selling, administrative, and other expenses. We include within cost of sales those costs related to the development, production, and distribution of our vehicles, parts, accessories, and services. Specifically, we include in cost of sales each of the following: material costs (including commodity costs); freight costs; warranty, including product recall costs; labor and other costs related to the development and production of our vehicles and connectivity, parts, accessories, and services; depreciation and amortization; and other associated costs. We include within selling, administrative, and other expenses labor and other costs not directly related to the development and production of our vehicles, parts, accessories, and services, including such expenses as advertising and sales promotion costs. \\n \\n Certain of our costs, such as material costs, generally vary directly with changes in volume and mix of production. In our industry, production volume often varies significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. Quarterly production volumes experience seasonal shifts throughout the year (including peak retail sales seasons and the impact on production of model changeover and new product launches). Annual production volumes are heavily impacted by external economic factors, including the pace of economic growth and factors such as the availability of consumer credit and cost of fuel. \\n \\n As a result, we analyze the profit impact of certain cost changes holding constant present-year volume and mix and currency exchange, in order to evaluate our cost trends absent the impact of varying production and currency exchange levels. We analyze these cost changes in the following categories: \\n \\n Contribution Costs these costs typically vary with production volume. These costs include material (including commodity), warranty, and freight and duty costs. \\n \\n Structural Costs these costs typically do not have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume. These costs include manufacturing; vehicle and software engineering; spending-related; advertising and sales promotion; administrative, information technology, and selling; and pension and OPEB costs. \\n \\n While contribution costs generally vary directly in proportion to production volume, elements within our structural costs category are impacted to differing degrees by changes in production volume. We also have varying degrees of discretion when it comes to controlling the different elements within our structural costs. For example, depreciation and amortization expense largely is associated with prior capital spending decisions. On the other hand, while labor costs do not vary directly with production volume, manufacturing labor costs may be impacted by changes in volume, for example when we increase overtime, add a production shift, or add personnel to support volume increases. Other structural costs, such as advertising or engineering costs, do not necessarily have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume. Our structural costs generally are within our discretion, although to varying degrees, and can be adjusted over time in response to external factors. \\n \\n We consider certain structural costs to be a direct investment in future growth and revenue. For example, structural costs are necessary to grow our business and improve profitability, invest in new products and technologies, respond to increasing industry sales volume, and grow our market share. \\n \\n Cost of sales and Selling, administrative, and other expenses for full year 2023 were 161.3 billion. Company excluding Ford Credit s total material and commodity costs make up the largest portion of these costs and expenses, followed by structural costs. Although material costs are our largest absolute cost, our margins can be affected significantly by changes in any category of costs. \\n 42 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 2023 \\n \\n The net income attributable to Ford Motor Company was 4,347 million in 2023. Company adjusted EBIT was 10,416 million. \\n \\n Net income/(loss) includes certain items special items that are excluded from Company adjusted EBIT. These items are discussed in more detail in Note 26 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. We report special items separately to allow investors analyzing our results to identify certain infrequent significant items that they may wish to exclude when considering the trend of ongoing operating results. Our pre-tax and tax special items were as follows (in millions): \\n 2022 2023 Restructuring (by Geography) China (380) (958) Europe (151) (978) Ford Credit - Brazil (155) Other (a) (436) (87) Subtotal Restructuring (1,122) (2,023) Other Items Gain/(loss) on Rivian investment (7,377) (31) AV strategy including Argo impairment (2,812) Transit Connect customs matter (396) Russia suspension of operations/asset write-off (158) Patent matters related to prior calendar years (124) 8 EV program dispute (143) Other (including gains/(losses) on investments) (170) (165) Subtotal Other Items (10,641) (727) Pension and OPEB Gain/(Loss) Pension and OPEB remeasurement 29 (2,058) Pension settlements and curtailments (438) (339) Subtotal Pension and OPEB Gain/(Loss) (409) (2,397) Total EBIT Special Items (12,172) (5,147) Provision for/(Benefit from) tax special items (b) (2,573) (1,273) \\n __________ \\n (a) 2022 includes 298 million related to restructuring charges in India and 198 million in North America. 2023 includes 28 million related to restructuring charges in India and 41 million in North America. \\n (b) Includes related tax effect on special items and tax special items. \\n \\n We recorded 5.1 billion of pre-tax special item charges in 2023, driven primarily by pension and OPEB remeasurement, restructuring actions in Europe and China, and the Transit Connect customs matter. \\n \\n In Note 26 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, special items are reflected as a separate reconciling item, as opposed to being allocated among our segments. This reflects the fact that management excludes these items from its review of operating segment results for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources. \\n 43 \\n\\nItem 7.

The flat year-over-year Company adjusted EBIT primarily reflects higher Ford Pro and Ford Blue EBIT and a lower EBIT loss in Ford Next. Offsets included higher EBIT losses in Ford Model e, lower past service pension and OPEB income in Corporate Other, and lower Ford Credit EBT. \\n \\n 44 \\n\\nItem 7.

The EBIT improvement was driven by higher net pricing, lower commodity costs, and higher wholesales. Partial offsets primarily include higher material costs (related to inflationary cost pressures, new products, and about 80 million of volume-related obligations for batteries), higher warranty costs (reflecting inflationary cost pressures and increased field service actions), and higher structural costs (including volume-related) and supplemental compensation (including the impact of the new UAW collective bargaining agreement). \\n 46 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Definitions and Information Regarding Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro Causal Factors \\n \\n In general, we measure year-over-year change in Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro segment EBIT using the causal factors listed below, with net pricing and cost variances calculated at present-year volume and mix and exchange: \\n \\n Market Factors (exclude the impact of unconsolidated affiliate wholesale units): \\n Volume and Mix primarily measures EBIT variance from changes in wholesale unit volumes (at prior-year average contribution margin per unit) driven by changes in industry volume, market share, and dealer stocks, as well as the EBIT variance resulting from changes in product mix, including mix among vehicle lines and mix of trim levels and options within a vehicle line \\n Net Pricing primarily measures EBIT variance driven by changes in wholesale unit prices to dealers and marketing incentive programs such as rebate programs, low-rate financing offers, special lease offers, and stock adjustments on dealer inventory \\n \\n Cost: \\n Contribution Costs primarily measures EBIT variance driven by per-unit changes in cost categories that typically vary with volume, such as material costs (including commodity and component costs), warranty expense, and freight and duty costs \\n Structural Costs primarily measures EBIT variance driven by absolute change in cost categories that typically do not have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume. Structural costs include the following cost categories: \\n Manufacturing, Including Volume-Related - consists primarily of costs for hourly and salaried manufacturing personnel, plant overhead (such as utilities and taxes), and new product launch expense. These costs could be affected by volume for operating pattern actions such as overtime, line-speed, and shift schedules \\n Engineering and Connectivity consists primarily of costs for vehicle and software engineering personnel, prototype materials, testing, and outside engineering and software services \\n Spending-Related consists primarily of depreciation and amortization of our manufacturing and engineering assets, but also includes asset retirements and operating leases \\n Advertising and Sales Promotions includes costs for advertising, marketing programs, brand promotions, customer mailings and promotional events, and auto shows \\n Administrative, Information Technology, and Selling includes primarily costs for salaried personnel and purchased services related to our staff activities, information technology, and selling functions \\n Pension and OPEB consists primarily of past service pension costs and other postretirement employee benefit costs \\n \\n Exchange primarily measures EBIT variance driven by one or more of the following: (i) transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the relevant entities, (ii) effects of converting functional currency income to U.S. dollars, (iii) effects of remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities of the relevant entities in currencies other than their functional currency, or (iv) results of our foreign currency hedging \\n \\n Other includes a variety of items, such as parts and services earnings, royalties, government incentives, and compensation-related changes \\n \\n In addition, definitions and calculations used in this report include: \\n \\n Wholesales and Revenue wholesale unit volumes include all Ford and Lincoln badged units (whether produced by Ford or by an unconsolidated affiliate) that are sold to dealerships or others, units manufactured by Ford that are sold to other manufacturers, units distributed by Ford for other manufacturers, and local brand units produced by our China joint venture, Jiangling Motors Corporation, Ltd. JMC ), that are sold to dealerships or others. Vehicles sold to daily rental car companies that are subject to a guaranteed repurchase option (i.e., rental repurchase), as well as other sales of finished vehicles for which the recognition of revenue is deferred (e.g., consignments), also are included in wholesale unit volumes. Revenue from certain vehicles in wholesale unit volumes (specifically, Ford badged vehicles produced and distributed by our unconsolidated affiliates, as well as JMC brand vehicles) are not included in our revenue \\n \\n Industry Volume and Market Share based, in part, on estimated vehicle registrations; includes medium and heavy duty trucks \\n \\n SAAR seasonally adjusted annual rate \\n 47 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Ford Next Segment \\n \\n The Ford Next segment (formerly Mobility) primarily includes expenses and investments for emerging business initiatives aimed at creating value for Ford in vehicle-adjacent market segments. \\n \\n In this segment, our 2023 EBIT loss was 138 million, a 788 million improvement from a year ago. Ford Next has evolved from primarily investing in the development of autonomous vehicle capabilities to focus exclusively on incubating and launching new businesses creating strategic value for Ford. \\n 48 \\n\\nItem 7.

Ford Credit s loss metrics continue to normalize from historic lows. Ford Credit s U.S. 36-month auction values for off-lease vehicles were down 7 from a year ago. We are planning for full year 2024 auction values to decrease as vehicle availability continues to improve. \\n \\n Ford Credit s 2023 EBT of 1,331 million was 1,326 million lower than a year ago, reflecting lower financing margin, non-recurrence of supplemental depreciation and credit loss reserve releases, lower lease residual performance, unfavorable derivative market valuation, and higher credit losses. \\n 49 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Definitions and Information Regarding Ford Credit Causal Factors \\n \\n In general, we measure year-over-year changes in Ford Credit s EBT using the causal factors listed below: \\n \\n Volume and Mix: \\n Volume primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by changes in average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses at prior period financing margin yield (defined below in financing margin) at prior period exchange rates. Volume changes are primarily driven by the volume of new and used vehicles sold and leased, the extent to which Ford Credit purchases retail financing and operating lease contracts, the extent to which Ford Credit provides wholesale financing, the sales price of the vehicles financed, the level of dealer inventories, Ford-sponsored special financing programs available exclusively through Ford Credit, and the availability of cost-effective funding \\n Mix primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by period-over-period changes in the composition of Ford Credit s average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses by product within each region \\n \\n Financing Margin: \\n Financing margin variance is the period-over-period change in financing margin yield multiplied by the present period average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses at prior period exchange rates. This calculation is performed at the product and country level and then aggregated. Financing margin yield equals revenue, less interest expense and scheduled depreciation for the period, divided by average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses for the same period \\n Financing margin changes are driven by changes in revenue and interest expense. Changes in revenue are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, cost assumptions in pricing, mix of business, and competitive environment. Changes in interest expense are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, borrowing spreads, and asset-liability management \\n \\n Credit Loss: \\n Credit loss is the change in the provision for credit losses at prior period exchange rates. For analysis purposes, management splits the provision for credit losses into net charge-offs and the change in the allowance for credit losses \\n Net charge-off changes are primarily driven by the number of repossessions, severity per repossession, and recoveries. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are primarily driven by changes in historical trends in credit losses and recoveries, changes in the composition and size of Ford Credit s present portfolio, changes in trends in historical used vehicle values, and changes in forward looking macroeconomic conditions. For additional information, refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates - Allowance for Credit Losses section of Item 7 \\n \\n Lease Residual: \\n Lease residual measures changes to residual performance at prior period exchange rates. For analysis purposes, management splits residual performance primarily into residual gains and losses, and the change in accumulated supplemental depreciation \\n Residual gain and loss changes are primarily driven by the number of vehicles returned to Ford Credit and sold, and the difference between the auction value and the depreciated value (which includes both base and accumulated supplemental depreciation) of the vehicles sold. Changes in accumulated supplemental depreciation are primarily driven by changes in Ford Credit s estimate of the expected auction value at the end of the lease term, and changes in Ford Credit s estimate of the number of vehicles that will be returned to it and sold. Depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases includes early termination losses on operating leases due to customer default events. For additional information, refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates - Accumulated Depreciation on Vehicles Subject to Operating Leases section of Item 7 \\n \\n Exchange: \\n Reflects changes in EBT driven by the effects of converting functional currency income to U.S. dollars \\n \\n Other: \\n Primarily includes operating expenses, other revenue, insurance expenses, and other income/(loss) at prior period exchange rates \\n Changes in operating expenses are primarily driven by salaried personnel costs, facilities costs, and costs associated with the origination and servicing of customer contracts \\n In general, other income/(loss) changes are primarily driven by changes in earnings related to market valuation adjustments to derivatives (primarily related to movements in interest rates) and other miscellaneous items \\n 50 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n In addition, the following definitions and calculations apply to Ford Credit when used in this Report: \\n \\n Cash (as shown in the Funding Structure and Liquidity tables) Cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash, excluding amounts related to insurance activities \\n \\n Debt (as shown in the Key Metrics and Leverage tables) Debt on Ford Credit s balance sheets. Includes debt issued in securitizations and payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets and related enhancements. Ford Credit holds the right to receive the excess cash flows not needed to pay the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions \\n \\n Earnings Before Taxes EBT Reflects Ford Credit s income before income taxes \\n \\n Loss-to-Receivables LTR Ratio LTR ratio is calculated using net charge-offs divided by average finance receivables, excluding unearned interest supplements and the allowance for credit losses \\n \\n Return on Equity ROE (as shown in the Key Metrics table) Reflects return on equity calculated by annualizing net income for the period and dividing by monthly average equity for the period \\n \\n Securitization and Restricted Cash (as shown in the Liquidity table) Securitization cash is held for the benefit of the securitization investors (for example, a reserve fund). Restricted cash primarily includes cash held to meet certain local governmental and regulatory reserve requirements and cash held under the terms of certain contractual agreements \\n \\n Securitizations (as shown in the Public Term Funding Plan table) Public securitization transactions, Rule 144A offerings sponsored by Ford Credit, and widely distributed offerings by Ford Credit Canada \\n \\n Term Asset-Backed Securities (as shown in the Funding Structure table) Obligations issued in securitization transactions that are payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets and related enhancements \\n \\n Total Net Receivables (as shown in the Key Metrics table) Includes finance receivables (retail financing and wholesale) sold for legal purposes and net investment in operating leases included in securitization transactions that do not satisfy the requirements for accounting sale treatment. These receivables and operating leases are reported on Ford Credit s balance sheets and are available only for payment of the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions; they are not available to pay the other obligations of Ford Credit or the claims of Ford Credit s other creditors \\n \\n 51 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Corporate Other \\n \\n Corporate Other primarily includes corporate governance expenses, past service pension and OPEB income and expense, interest income (excluding Ford Credit interest income and interest earned on our extended service contract portfolio) and gains and losses from our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding gains and losses on investments in equity securities), and foreign exchange derivatives gains and losses associated with intercompany lending. Corporate governance expenses are primarily administrative, delivering benefit on behalf of the global enterprise, that are not allocated to operating segments. These include expenses related to setting and directing global policy, providing oversight and stewardship, and promoting the Company s interests. For full year 2023, Corporate Other had a 760 million EBIT loss, compared with 748 million of positive EBIT in 2022. The EBIT deterioration was driven by lower past service pension and OPEB income, partially offset by higher Company excluding Ford Credit interest income, reflecting higher interest rates. \\n\\nInterest on Debt \\n \\n Interest on Debt consists of interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit. Our full year 2023 interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit was 1,302 million, 43 million higher than in 2022. \\n\\nTaxes \\n \\n Our Provision for/(Benefit from) income taxes for full year 2023 was a 362 million benefit, resulting in an effective tax rate of negative 9.1 . This includes benefits arising from U.S. research tax credits and legal entity restructuring within our leasing operations and China. \\n \\n Our full year 2023 adjusted effective tax rate, which excludes special items, was 10.0 . \\n \\n We regularly review our organizational structure and income tax elections for affiliates in non-U.S. and U.S. tax jurisdictions, which may result in changes in affiliates that are included in or excluded from our U.S. tax return. Any future changes to our structure, as well as any changes in income tax laws in the countries that we operate, could cause increases or decreases to our deferred tax balances and related valuation allowances. \\n 52 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 2022 \\n \\n The net loss attributable to Ford Motor Company was 1,981 million in 2022. Company adjusted EBIT was 10,415 million. \\n \\n Net income/(loss) includes certain items special items that are excluded from Company adjusted EBIT. These items are discussed in more detail in Note 26 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.

Ford Credit s loss metrics reflected healthy and stable consumer credit conditions and strong auction values. Ford Credit s U.S. 36-month auction values for off-lease vehicles were up 5 from 2021, reflecting strong demand for used vehicles, including the impact of lower new vehicle production due to the semiconductor shortage. \\n \\n Ford Credit s 2022 EBT of 2,657 million was 2,060 million lower than 2021, reflecting lower credit loss and lease residual reserve releases, lower financing margin, and lower lease return rates. \\n \\n 57 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Corporate Other \\n \\n For full year 2022, Corporate Other EBIT was 748 million, compared with EBIT of 1,247 million in 2021. The deterioration was driven by lower past service pension and OPEB income. \\n\\nInterest on Debt \\n \\n Our full year 2022 interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit was 1,259 million, 544 million lower than in 2021, primarily explained by U.S. debt restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2021 and during 2022. \\n\\nTaxes \\n \\n Our Provision for/(Benefit from) income taxes for full year 2022 was a 864 million benefit, resulting in an effective tax rate of 28.6 . This includes benefits arising from the reversal of U.S. valuation allowances, primarily as a result of planning actions. \\n \\n Our full year 2022 adjusted effective tax rate, which excludes special items, was 18.7 . \\n 58 \\n\\nItem 7.

Our key priority is to maintain a strong balance sheet to withstand potential stress scenarios, while having resources available to invest in and grow our business. At December 31, 2023, we had Company cash of 28.8 billion and liquidity of 46.4 billion. At December 31, 2023, about 90 of Company cash was held by consolidated entities domiciled in the United States. \\n \\n To be prepared for an economic downturn and other stress scenarios, we target an ongoing Company cash balance at or above 20 billion plus significant additional liquidity above our Company cash target. We expect to have periods when we will be above or below this amount due to: (i) future cash flow expectations, such as for investments in future opportunities, capital investments, debt maturities, pension contributions, or restructuring requirements, (ii) short-term timing differences, and (iii) changes in the global economic or operating environment. \\n \\n Our Company cash investments primarily include U.S. Department of Treasury obligations, federal agency securities, bank time deposits with investment-grade institutions, investment-grade corporate securities, investment-grade commercial paper, and debt obligations of a select group of non-U.S. governments, non-U.S. governmental agencies, and supranational institutions. The average maturity of these investments is approximately one year and adjusted based on market conditions and liquidity needs. We monitor our Company cash levels and average maturity on a daily basis. \\n\\n59 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Material Cash Requirements. Our material cash requirements include: \\n \\n Capital expenditures (for additional information, see the Changes in Company Cash section below) and other payments for engineering, software, product development, and implementation of our plans for electric vehicles \\n \\n Purchase of raw materials and components to support the manufacturing and sale of vehicles (including electric vehicles), parts, and accessories (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table and the accompanying description of our Purchase obligations below) \\n \\n Marketing incentive payments to dealers \\n \\n Payments for warranty and field service actions (for additional information, see Note 25 of the Notes to the Financial Statements) \\n \\n Debt repayments (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table below and Note 19 of the Notes the Financial Statements) \\n \\n Discretionary and mandatory payments to our global pension plans (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table below, the Changes in Company Cash section below, and Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements) \\n \\n Employee wages, benefits, and incentives \\n \\n Operating lease payments (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table below and Note 18 of the Notes to the Financial Statements) \\n \\n Cash effects related to the restructuring of our business \\n \\n Strategic acquisitions and investments to grow our business, including electrification \\n \\n Subject to approval by our Board of Directors, shareholder distributions in the form of dividend payments and/or a share repurchase program (including share repurchases to offset the anti-dilutive effect of increased shared-based compensation) may require the expenditure of a material amount of cash. We target shareholder distributions of 40 to 50 of adjusted free cash flow. Moreover, we may be subject to additional material cash requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, e.g., legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions, and other matters. \\n \\n We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties, and, as noted above, such commitments require a material amount of cash. Most of these are debt obligations incurred by our Ford Credit segment. In addition, as part of our normal business practices, we enter into contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components, and services to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services. These arrangements, including multi-year offtake commitments, may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase requirements. Purchase obligations in the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table below are defined as off-balance sheet agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms; however, as we purchase raw materials and components beyond the minimum amounts required by the Purchase obligations, our material cash requirements for these items are higher than what is reflected in the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table. For additional information on the timing of these payments and the impact on our working capital, see the Changes in Company Cash section below. \\n 60 \\n\\nItem 7.

For long-term debt with variable-rate interest, we estimate the future interest payments based on projected market interest rates for various floating-rate benchmarks received from third parties. \\n (c) Includes interest payments of 254 million. \\n (d) Excludes approximately 449 million in future lease payments for various operating leases commencing in a future period. \\n (e) Amounts represent our estimate of contractually obligated contributions to the Ford-Werke plan. See Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for further information regarding our expected pension contributions. \\n (f) Purchase obligations under existing offtake agreements for scarce raw materials are not included in the table above. As of December 31, 2023, our estimated expenditures for the maximum quantity that we are committed to purchase under these offtake agreements through 2035, subject to certain conditions, consist of approximately 4.5 billion of purchase obligations and approximately 8 billion of contingent purchase obligations based on our present forecast. However, our forecast could fluctuate from period to period based on market prices, which could result in significant increases or decreases in our estimate. The actual price paid for these materials will be recorded on our balance sheet at the time of purchase. In addition, as market conditions dictate, we may enter into additional offtake agreements with raw material suppliers or seek to renegotiate existing agreements. For additional information, see the discussion of our offtake agreements below on page 62. \\n \\n We plan to utilize our liquidity (as described above) and our cash flows from business operations to fund our material cash requirements. \\n \\n Changes in Company Cash. In managing our business, we classify changes in Company cash into operating and non-operating items. Operating items include: Company adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit EBT, capital spending, depreciation and tooling amortization, changes in working capital, Ford Credit distributions, interest on debt, cash taxes, and all other and timing differences (including timing differences between accrual-based EBIT and associated cash flows). Non-operating items include: restructuring costs, changes in Company debt excluding Ford Credit, contributions to funded pension plans, shareholder distributions, and other items (including gains and losses on investments in equity securities, acquisitions and divestitures, equity investments, and other transactions with Ford Credit). \\n\\n61 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n With respect to Changes in working capital, in general, the Company excluding Ford Credit carries relatively low trade receivables compared with our trade payables because the majority of our wholesales are financed (primarily by Ford Credit) immediately upon the sale of vehicles to dealers, which generally occurs shortly after being produced. In contrast, our trade payables are based primarily on industry-standard production supplier payment terms of about 45 days. As a result, our cash flow deteriorates if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) decrease while trade payables continue to become due. Conversely, our cash flow improves if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) increase while new trade payables are generally not due for about 45 days. For example, the suspension of production at most of our assembly plants and lower industry volumes due to COVID-19 in early 2020 resulted in an initial deterioration of our cash flow, while the subsequent resumption of manufacturing operations and return to pre-COVID-19 production levels at most of our assembly plants resulted in a subsequent improvement of our cash flow. Even in normal economic conditions, however, these working capital balances generally are subject to seasonal changes that can impact cash flow. For example, we typically experience cash flow timing differences associated with inventories and payables due to our annual shutdown periods when production, and therefore inventories and wholesale volumes, are usually at their lowest levels, while payables continue to come due and be paid. The net impact of this typically results in cash outflows from changes in our working capital balances during these shutdown periods. \\n \\n Our finished product inventory at December 31, 2023 was higher than at December 31, 2022, primarily reflecting higher in-transit inventory. \\n \\n In response to, or in anticipation of, supplier disruptions, we may stockpile certain components or raw materials to help prevent disruption in our production of vehicles. Such actions could have a short-term adverse impact on our cash and increase our inventory. Moreover, in order to secure critical materials for production of electric vehicles, we have entered into and we may, in the future, enter into offtake agreements with raw material suppliers and make investments in certain raw material and battery suppliers, including contributing up to a maximum of 6.6 billion in capital to BlueOval SK, LLC over a five-year period ending in 2026. Our actual capital outlay could vary significantly based on the final project costs and potential financing opportunities. Such investments could have an additional adverse impact on our cash in the near-term. \\n \\n The terms of the offtake agreements we have entered into, and those we may enter into in the future, vary by transaction, though they generally obligate us to purchase a certain percentage or minimum amount of output produced by the counterparty over an agreed upon period of time. The purchase price mechanism included in the offtake agreement is typically based on the market price of the material at the time of delivery. The terms also may include conditions to our obligation to purchase the materials, such as quality or minimum output. Subject to satisfaction of those conditions, we will be obligated to purchase the materials at the cost determined by the purchase price mechanism. Based on the offtake agreements we have entered into thus far, the earliest date by which we could be obligated to purchase any output, subject to satisfaction of the applicable conditions, will be in 2024. \\n \\n Unlike our historical arrangements with suppliers, under multi-year offtake agreements, the risks associated with lower-than-expected electric vehicle production volumes or changes in battery technology that reduce the need for certain raw materials are borne by Ford rather than our suppliers. Accordingly, in the event we do not purchase the materials pursuant to the terms of these agreements and we are unable to restructure an agreement or an alternate purchaser is unable to be found, Ford retains its obligation for the cost of those materials. For additional discussion of the risks related to our offtake agreements and other long-term purchase contracts, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. \\n \\n Financial institutions participate in a supply chain finance SCF program that enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their Ford receivables (i.e., our payment obligations to the suppliers) to the financial institutions on a non-recourse basis in order to be paid earlier than our payment terms provide. Our suppliers voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms, the amounts we pay, or our liquidity. We have no economic interest in a supplier s decision to participate in the SCF program, and we do not provide any guarantees in connection with it. As of December 31, 2023, the outstanding amount of Ford receivables that suppliers elected to sell to the SCF financial institutions was 220 million. The amount settled through the SCF program during 2023 was 1.8 billion. \\n \\n 62 \\n\\nItem 7.

The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher net income. \\n \\n Company adjusted free cash flow was 6.8 billion, 2.3 billion lower than a year ago. An improvement in Company adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit and timing differences were more than offset by the non-repeat of working capital improvements and Ford Credit distributions, as well as higher capital spending. \\n \\n Capital spending was 8.2 billion in 2023, 1.6 billion higher than a year ago, and is expected to be in the range of 8 billion to 9.5 billion in 2024. \\n \\n The full year 2023 working capital impact was 2.4 billion negative, driven by an increase in inventory and receivables. All other and timing differences were positive 5.2 billion. Timing differences include differences between accrual-based EBIT and the associated cash flows (e.g., marketing incentive and warranty payments to dealers, JV equity income, compensation payments, and pension and OPEB income or expense). \\n \\n Shareholder distributions (including cash dividends and anti-dilutive share repurchases) were 5.3 billion in 2023. On February 6, 2024, we declared a regular dividend of 0.15 per share and a supplemental dividend of 0.18 per share. \\n 63 \\n\\nItem 7.

Total Company committed credit lines, excluding Ford Credit, at December 31, 2023 were 19.4 billion, consisting of 13.5 billion of our corporate credit facility, 2.0 billion of our supplemental revolving credit facility, 1.8 billion of our 364-day revolving credit facility, and 2.2 billion of local credit facilities. At December 31, 2023, the utilized portion of the corporate credit facility was 18 million, representing amounts utilized for letters of credit. In addition, 1.8 billion of committed Company credit lines, excluding Ford Credit, was utilized under local credit facilities for our affiliates as of December 31, 2023. \\n \\n Lenders under our corporate credit facility have 3.4 billion of commitments maturing on April 26, 2026 and 10.1 billion of commitments maturing on April 26, 2028. Lenders under our supplemental revolving credit facility have 0.1 billion of commitments maturing on September 29, 2024 and 1.9 billion of commitments maturing on April 26, 2026. Lenders under our 364-day revolving credit facility have 1.8 billion of commitments maturing on April 24, 2024. \\n \\n On August 17, 2023, we entered into a new 364-day revolving credit facility, with 4 billion of commitments maturing on August 15, 2024. At the time we entered into this credit facility, it provided additional working capital flexibility to manage through uncertainties in the present environment, including a potential labor disruption. With the ratification of the new UAW contract, this credit facility was terminated as of November 24, 2023. \\n \\n The corporate, supplemental, and 364-day credit agreements include certain sustainability-linked targets, pursuant to which the applicable margin and facility fees may be adjusted if Ford achieves, or fails to achieve, the specified targets related to global manufacturing facility greenhouse gas emissions, renewable electricity consumption, and Ford Europe CO 2 tailpipe emissions. Ford outperformed the 2022 targets for all three of the sustainability-linked metrics, which favorably impacted pricing beginning in the third quarter of 2023 . \\n \\n The corporate credit facility is unsecured and free of material adverse change conditions to borrowing, restrictive financial covenants (for example, interest or fixed-charge coverage ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and minimum net worth requirements), and credit rating triggers that could limit our ability to obtain funding or trigger early repayment. The corporate credit facility contains a liquidity covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum of 4 billion in aggregate of domestic cash, cash equivalents, and loaned and marketable securities and/or availability under the corporate credit facility, supplemental revolving credit facility, and 364-day revolving credit facility. The terms and conditions of the supplemental and 364-day revolving credit facilities are consistent with our corporate credit facility. Ford Credit has been designated as a subsidiary borrower under the corporate credit facility and the 364-day revolving credit facility. \\n \\n Each of the corporate credit facility, supplemental revolving credit facility, and 364-day revolving credit facility include a covenant that requires us to provide guarantees from certain of our subsidiaries in the event that our senior, unsecured, long-term debt does not maintain at least two investment grade ratings from Fitch, Moody s, and S P. On October 30, 2023, following the upgrade by S P of our senior, unsecured, long-term debt credit rating to BBB-, the unsecured guarantees provided by the following subsidiaries to the lenders under the credit facilities were released: Ford Component Sales, LLC; Ford European Holdings Inc.; Ford Global Technologies, LLC; Ford Holdings LLC (the parent company of Ford Credit); Ford International Capital LLC; Ford Mexico Holdings LLC; Ford Motor Service Company; Ford Next LLC; Ford Trading Company, LLC; and Ford Van Dyke Investment Fund, Inc. \\n \\n Debt. As shown in Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, at December 31, 2023, Company debt excluding Ford Credit was 19.9 billion, unchanged from December 31, 2022. \\n \\n Leverage. We manage Company debt (excluding Ford Credit) levels with a leverage framework that targets investment grade credit ratings through a normal business cycle. The leverage framework includes a ratio of total Company debt (excluding Ford Credit), underfunded pension liabilities, operating leases, and other adjustments, divided by Company adjusted EBIT (excluding Ford Credit EBT), and further adjusted to exclude depreciation and tooling amortization (excluding Ford Credit). \\n \\n Ford Credit s leverage is calculated as a separate business as described in the Liquidity - Ford Credit Segment section of Item 7. Ford Credit is self-funding and its debt, which is used to fund its operations, is separate from our Company debt excluding Ford Credit. \\n \\n 64 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Ford Credit Segment \\n \\n Ford Credit remains well capitalized with a strong balance sheet and funding diversified across platforms and markets. Ford Credit continues to have robust access to the capital markets, and ended 2023 with 25.7 billion of liquidity, up 4.6 billion from 2022. \\n \\n Key elements of Ford Credit s funding strategy include: \\n \\n Maintain strong liquidity and funding diversity \\n Prudently access public markets \\n Continue to leverage retail deposit funding in Europe \\n Flexibility to increase ABS mix as needed; preserving assets and committed capacity \\n Target financial statement leverage of 9:1 to 10:1 \\n Maintain self-liquidating balance sheet \\n \\n Ford Credit s liquidity profile continues to be diverse, robust, and focused on maintaining liquidity levels that meet its business and funding requirements. Ford Credit regularly stress tests its balance sheet and liquidity to ensure that it can continue to meet its financial obligations through economic cycles. \\n \\n Funding Sources. Ford Credit s funding sources include primarily unsecured debt and securitization transactions (including other structured financings). Ford Credit issues both short-term and long-term debt that is held by both institutional and retail investors, with long-term debt having an original maturity of more than 12 months. Ford Credit sponsors a number of securitization programs that can be structured to provide both short-term and long-term funding through institutional investors and other financial institutions in the United States and international capital markets. \\n \\n Ford Credit obtains unsecured funding from the sale of demand notes under its Ford Interest Advantage program and through the retail deposit programs at FCE Bank plc FCE and Ford Bank GmbH Ford Bank ). At December 31, 2023, the principal amount outstanding of Ford Interest Advantage notes, which may be redeemed at any time at the option of the holders thereof without restriction, and FCE and Ford Bank deposits was 17.2 billion. Ford Credit maintains multiple sources of readily available liquidity to fund the payment of its unsecured short-term debt obligations. \\n \\n The following table shows funding for Ford Credit s net receivables (in billions): December 31, 2021 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2023 Funding Structure Term unsecured debt 59.4 48.3 54.1 Term asset-backed securities 45.4 56.4 58.0 Retail Deposits / Ford Interest Advantage 12.9 14.3 17.2 Other (0.1) 2.7 1.4 Equity 12.4 11.9 13.4 Adjustments for cash (12.5) (11.3) (10.9) Total Net Receivables 117.5 122.3 133.2 Securitized Funding as Percent of Total Debt 38.5 47.4 44.9 \\n \\n Net receivables of 133.2 billion at December 31, 2023 were funded primarily with term unsecured debt and term asset-backed securities. Securitized funding as a percent of total debt was 44.9 as of December 31, 2023. \\n\\n65 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Public Term Funding Plan. The following table shows Ford Credit s issuances for full year 2021, 2022, and 2023, and its planned issuances for full year 2024, excluding short-term funding programs (in billions): \\n 2021 \\n Actual \\n 2022 \\n Actual \\n 2023 \\n Actual \\n 2024 \\n Forecast \\n Unsecured 5 6 14 14 - 17 Securitizations 9 10 14 13 - 16 Total public 14 16 28 27 - 33 \\n \\n In 2023, Ford Credit completed 28 billion of public term funding. For 2024, Ford Credit projects full year public term funding in the range of 27 billion to 33 billion. Through February 5, 2024, we completed 5 billion of public term issuances. \\n \\n Liquidity. The following table shows Ford Credit s liquidity sources and utilization (in billions): \\n December 31, 2021 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2023 Liquidity Sources (a) \\n Cash 12.5 11.3 10.9 Committed asset-backed facilities 37.1 37.4 42.9 Other unsecured credit facilities 2.7 2.3 2.4 Total liquidity sources 52.3 51.0 56.2 Utilization of Liquidity (a) \\n Securitization cash and restricted cash (3.9) (2.9) (2.8) Committed asset-backed facilities (12.5) (26.6) (27.5) Other unsecured credit facilities (1.0) (0.8) (0.4) Total utilization of liquidity (17.4) (30.3) (30.7) Gross liquidity 34.9 20.7 25.5 Asset-backed capacity in excess of eligible receivables and other adjustments (2.8) 0.4 0.2 Net liquidity available for use 32.1 21.1 25.7 \\n __________ \\n (a) See Definitions and Information Regarding Ford Credit Causal Factors section. \\n \\n Ford Credit s net liquidity available for use will fluctuate quarterly based on factors including near-term debt maturities, receivable growth and decline, and timing of funding transactions. At December 31, 2023, Ford Credit s net liquidity available for use was 25.7 billion, 4.6 billion higher than year-end 2022, reflecting strong access to public funding markets and the addition of 5.5 billion in committed asset-backed capacity. Ford Credit s sources of liquidity include cash, committed asset-backed facilities, and unsecured credit facilities. At December 31, 2023, Ford Credit s liquidity sources, including cash, committed asset-backed facilities, and unsecured credit facilities, totaled 56.2 billion, up 5.2 billion from year-end 2022. \\n \\n Material Cash Requirements. Ford Credit s material cash requirements include: (1) the purchase of retail financing and operating lease contracts from dealers and providing wholesale financing for dealers to finance new and used vehicles; and (2) debt repayments (for additional information on debt, see the Balance Sheet Liquidity Profile section below, the Material Cash Requirements section in Liquidity and Capital Resources - Company excluding Ford Credit above, and Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements). In addition, subject to approval by Ford Credit s Board of Directors, shareholder distributions may require the expenditure of a material amount of cash. Moreover, Ford Credit may be subject to additional material cash requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, e.g., legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions, and other matters. \\n \\n Ford Credit plans to utilize its liquidity (as described above) and its cash flows from business operations to fund its material cash requirements. \\n \\n 66 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Balance Sheet Liquidity Profile. Ford Credit defines its balance sheet liquidity profile as the cumulative maturities, including the impact of expected prepayments and allowance for credit losses, of its finance receivables, investment in operating leases, and cash, less the cumulative debt maturities over upcoming annual periods. Ford Credit s balance sheet is inherently liquid because of the short-term nature of its finance receivables, investment in operating leases, and cash. Ford Credit ensures its cumulative debt maturities have a longer tenor than its cumulative asset maturities. This positive maturity profile is intended to provide Ford Credit with additional liquidity after all of its assets have been funded and is in addition to liquidity available to protect for stress scenarios. \\n \\n The following table shows Ford Credit s cumulative maturities for assets and total debt for the periods presented and unsecured long-term debt maturities in the individual periods presented (in billions): \\n 2024 2025 2026 2027 and Beyond \\n Balance Sheet Liquidity Profile Assets (a) 76 104 126 149 Total debt (b) 61 88 105 131 Memo: Unsecured long-term debt maturities 12 13 11 21 \\n __________ \\n (a) Includes gross finance receivables less the allowance for credit losses (including certain finance receivables that are reclassified in consolidation to Trade and other receivables ), investment in operating leases net of accumulated depreciation, cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding amounts related to insurance activities). Amounts shown include the impact of expected prepayments. \\n (b) Excludes unamortized debt (discount)/premium, unamortized issuance costs, and fair value adjustments. \\n \\n Maturities of investment in operating leases consist primarily of the portion of rental payments attributable to depreciation over the remaining life of the lease and the expected residual value at lease termination. Maturities of finance receivables and investment in operating leases in the table above include expected prepayments for Ford Credit s retail installment sale contracts and investment in operating leases. The table above also reflects adjustments to debt maturities to match the asset-backed debt maturities with the underlying asset maturities. \\n \\n All wholesale securitization transactions and wholesale receivables are shown maturing in the next 12 months, even if the maturities extend beyond 2024. The retail securitization transactions under certain committed asset-backed facilities are assumed to amortize immediately rather than amortizing after the expiration of the commitment period. As of December 31, 2023, Ford Credit had 149 billion of assets, 68 billion of which were unencumbered. \\n \\n Funding and Liquidity Risks. Ford Credit s funding plan is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control, including disruption in the capital markets that could impact both unsecured debt and asset-backed securities issuance and the effects of regulatory changes on the financial markets. \\n \\n Despite Ford Credit s diverse sources of funding and liquidity, its ability to maintain liquidity may be affected by, among others, the following factors (not necessarily listed in order of importance or probability of occurrence): \\n \\n Prolonged disruption of the debt and securitization markets; \\n Global capital markets volatility; \\n Credit ratings assigned to Ford and Ford Credit; \\n Market capacity for Ford- and Ford Credit-sponsored investments; \\n General demand for the type of securities Ford Credit offers; \\n Ford Credit s ability to continue funding through asset-backed financing structures; \\n Performance of the underlying assets within Ford Credit s asset-backed financing structures; \\n Inability to obtain hedging instruments; \\n Accounting and regulatory changes; and \\n Ford Credit s ability to maintain credit facilities and committed asset-backed facilities. \\n \\n Stress Tests. Ford Credit regularly conducts stress testing on its funding and liquidity sources to ensure it can continue to meet financial obligations and support the sale of Ford and Lincoln vehicles during firm-specific and market-wide stress events. Stress tests are intended to quantify the potential impact of various adverse scenarios on the balance sheet and liquidity. These scenarios include assumptions on access to unsecured and secured debt markets, runoff of short-term funding, and ability to renew expiring liquidity commitments and are measured over various time periods, including 30 days, 90 days, and longer term. Ford Credit s stress test does not assume any additional funding, liquidity, or capital support from Ford. Ford Credit routinely develops contingency funding plans as part of its liquidity stress testing. \\n 67 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Leverage. Ford Credit uses leverage, or the debt-to-equity ratio, to make various business decisions, including evaluating and establishing pricing for finance receivable and operating lease financing, and assessing its capital structure. \\n \\n The table below shows the calculation of Ford Credit s financial statement leverage (in billions): December 31, 2021 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2023 Leverage Calculation Debt 117.7 119.0 129.3 Equity (a) 12.4 11.9 13.4 Financial statement leverage (to 1) 9.5 10.0 9.7 \\n __________ \\n (a) Total shareholder s interest reported on Ford Credit s balance sheets. \\n \\n Ford Credit plans its leverage by considering market conditions and the risk characteristics of its business. At December 31, 2023, Ford Credit s financial statement leverage was 9.7:1. Ford Credit targets financial statement leverage in the range of 9:1 to 10:1. \\n 68 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Total Company \\n \\n Pension Plan Contributions and Strategy. Our strategy is to reduce the risk of our funded defined benefit pension plans, including minimizing the volatility of the value of our pension assets relative to pension liabilities and the need for unplanned use of capital resources to fund the plans. The strategy reduces balance sheet, cash flow, and income exposures and, in turn, reduces our risk profile. Going forward, we expect to: \\n \\n Limit our pension contributions to offset ongoing service cost, ensure our funded plans remain fully funded in aggregate, and meet regulatory requirements, if any; \\n Minimize the volatility of the value of our pension assets relative to pension obligations and ensure assets are sufficient to pay plan benefits; and \\n Evaluate strategic actions to reduce pension liabilities, such as plan design changes, curtailments, or settlements \\n 2022 2023 2023 \\n H / (L) \\n 2022 \\n Pension Funded Status B) \\n U.S. Plans 0.1 (1.3) (1.4) Non-U.S. Plans (0.3) (1.0) (0.7) Total Global Pension (0.2) (2.3) (2.1) Year-End Discount Rate (Weighted Average) \\n U.S. Plans 5.51 5.17 (34) bps Non-U.S. Plans 4.42 3.98 (44) bps Actual Asset Returns U.S. Plans (21.20) 7.41 28.61 ppts Non-U.S. Plans (25.40) 5.56 30.96 ppts Pension - Funded Plans Only B) \\n Funded Status 4.1 2.1 (2.0) Contributions for Funded Plans 0.6 0.6 \\n \\n Worldwide, our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by 2.3 billion at December 31, 2023, a deterioration of 2.1 billion from December 31, 2022, primarily reflecting the impact of lower discount rates compared to year-end 2022 and pension benefit enhancements as part of the collective bargaining agreements in the United States and Canada, partially offset by asset gains in excess of our assumptions. Of the 2.3 billion underfunded status at year-end 2023, our funded plans were 2.1 billion overfunded and our unfunded plans were 4.4 billion underfunded. These unfunded plans are pay as you go with benefits paid from Company cash and primarily include certain plans in Germany and U.S. defined benefit plans for senior management. \\n \\n The fixed income mix was 76 in our U.S. plans and 78 in our non-U.S. plans at year-end 2023. \\n \\n In 2023, we contributed 592 million to our global funded pension plans, an increase of 25 million compared with 2022. During 2024, we expect to contribute about 1 billion of cash to our global funded pension plans. We also expect to make about 400 million of benefit payments to participants in unfunded plans. Based on current assumptions and regulations, we do not expect to have a legal requirement to fund our major U.S. plans in 2024. Our global funded plans remain fully funded in aggregate, demonstrating the effectiveness of our de-risking strategy and our commitment to a strong balance sheet. \\n \\n For a detailed discussion of our pension plans, refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates - Pensions and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2023 Form 10-K Report and Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. \\n 69 \\n\\nItem 7.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n CREDIT RATINGS \\n \\n Our short-term and long-term debt is rated by four credit rating agencies designated as nationally recognized statistical rating organizations NRSROs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission: DBRS, Fitch, Moody s, and S P. \\n \\n In several markets, locally recognized rating agencies also rate us. A credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the credit risk associated with a corporate entity or particular securities issued by that entity. Rating agencies ratings of us are based on information provided by us and other sources. Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria for evaluating company risk and, therefore, ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. \\n \\n The following rating actions were taken by these NRSROs since the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023: \\n \\n On October 30, 2023, S P upgraded the credit ratings for Ford and Ford Credit to BBB- from BB+ and revised the outlook to stable from positive. \\n \\n The following table summarizes certain of the credit ratings and outlook presently assigned by these four NRSROs: NRSRO RATINGS Ford Ford Credit NRSROs Issuer Default / Corporate / Issuer Rating Long-Term Senior Unsecured Outlook / Trend Long-Term Senior Unsecured Short-Term Unsecured Outlook / Trend Minimum Long-Term Investment Grade Rating DBRS BBB (low) BBB (low) Stable BBB (low) R-2 (low) Stable BBB (low) Fitch BBB- BBB- Stable BBB- F3 Stable BBB- Moody s N/A Ba1 Stable Ba1 NP Stable Baa3 S P BBB- BBB- Stable BBB- A-3 Stable BBB- \\n \\n 71 \\n\\nItem 7.

Forward-looking statements are based on expectations, forecasts, and assumptions by our management and involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: \\n \\n Ford is highly dependent on its suppliers to deliver components in accordance with Ford s production schedule and specifications, and a shortage of or inability to acquire key components or raw materials, such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, can disrupt Ford s production of vehicles; \\n To facilitate access to the raw materials and other components necessary for the production of electric vehicles, Ford has entered into and may, in the future, enter into multi-year commitments to raw material and other suppliers that subject Ford to risks associated with lower future demand for such items as well as costs that fluctuate and are difficult to accurately forecast; \\n Ford s long-term competitiveness depends on the successful execution of Ford+; \\n Ford s vehicles could be affected by defects that result in recall campaigns, increased warranty costs, or delays in new model launches, and the time it takes to improve the quality of our vehicles and services could continue to have an adverse effect on our business; \\n Ford may not realize the anticipated benefits of existing or pending strategic alliances, joint ventures, acquisitions, divestitures, or business strategies; \\n Ford may not realize the anticipated benefits of restructuring actions and such actions may cause Ford to incur significant charges, disrupt our operations, or harm our reputation; \\n Operational information systems, security systems, vehicles, and services could be affected by cybersecurity incidents, ransomware attacks, and other disruptions and impact Ford and Ford Credit as well as their suppliers and dealers; \\n Ford s production, as well as Ford s suppliers production, and/or the ability to deliver products to consumers could be disrupted by labor issues, public health issues, natural or man-made disasters, adverse effects of climate change, financial distress, production difficulties, capacity limitations, or other factors; \\n Failure to develop and deploy secure digital services that appeal to customers could have a negative impact on Ford s business; \\n Ford s ability to maintain a competitive cost structure could be affected by labor or other constraints; \\n Ford s ability to attract, develop, grow, and reward talent is critical to its success and competitiveness; \\n Ford s new and existing products and digital, software, and physical services are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries, and its reputation may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced; \\n Ford s results are dependent on sales of larger, more profitable vehicles, particularly in the United States; \\n With a global footprint and supply chain, Ford s results and operations could be adversely affected by economic or geopolitical developments, including protectionist trade policies such as tariffs, or other events; \\n Industry sales volume can be volatile and could decline if there is a financial crisis, recession, public health emergency, or significant geopolitical event; \\n Ford may face increased price competition or a reduction in demand for its products resulting from industry excess capacity, currency fluctuations, competitive actions, or other factors, particularly for electric vehicles; \\n Inflationary pressure and fluctuations in commodity and energy prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and market value of Ford or Ford Credit s investments, including marketable securities, can have a significant effect on results; \\n Ford and Ford Credit s access to debt, securitization, or derivative markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts could be affected by credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, regulatory requirements, or other factors; \\n The impact of government incentives on Ford s business could be significant, and Ford s receipt of government incentives could be subject to reduction, termination, or clawback; \\n Ford Credit could experience higher-than-expected credit losses, lower-than-anticipated residual values, or higher-than-expected return volumes for leased vehicles; \\n Economic and demographic experience for pension and OPEB plans (e.g., discount rates or investment returns) could be worse than Ford has assumed; \\n Pension and other postretirement liabilities could adversely affect Ford s liquidity and financial condition; \\n Ford and Ford Credit could experience unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations, or adverse publicity arising out of alleged defects in products, services, perceived environmental impacts, or otherwise; \\n Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations; \\n Ford and Ford Credit could be affected by the continued development of more stringent privacy, data use, data protection, and artificial intelligence laws and regulations as well as consumers heightened expectations to safeguard their personal information; and \\n Ford Credit could be subject to new or increased credit regulations, consumer protection regulations, or other regulations. \\n 73 \\n\\nItem 7.

These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in items or events being adjusted. \\n \\n Company Adjusted EBIT (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Income/(Loss) Attributable to Ford) Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) excludes interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), taxes, and pre-tax special items. This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it focuses on underlying operating results and trends, and improves comparability of our period-over-period results. Our management ordinarily excludes special items from its review of the results of the operating segments for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources. Our categories of pre-tax special items and the applicable significance guideline for each item (which may consist of a group of items related to a single event or action) are as follows: \\n \\n Pre-Tax Special Item Significance Guideline Pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses No minimum Gains and losses on investments in equity securities No minimum Personnel expenses, supplier- and dealer-related costs, and facility-related charges stemming from our efforts to match production capacity and cost structure to market demand and changing model mix Generally 100 million or more Other items that we do not necessarily consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities 500 million or more for individual field service actions; generally 100 million or more for other items \\n \\n When we provide guidance for adjusted EBIT, we do not provide guidance on a net income basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty, including gains and losses on pension and OPEB remeasurements and on investments in equity securities. \\n \\n Company Adjusted EBIT Margin (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Company Net Income/(Loss) Margin) Company Adjusted EBIT margin is Company adjusted EBIT divided by Company revenue. This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it allows users to evaluate our operating results aligned with industry reporting. \\n \\n Adjusted Earnings/(Loss) Per Share (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Earnings/(Loss) Per Share) Measure of Company s diluted net earnings/(loss) per share adjusted for impact of pre-tax special items (described above), tax special items, and restructuring impacts in noncontrolling interests. The measure provides investors with useful information to evaluate performance of our business excluding items not indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities. When we provide guidance for adjusted earnings/(loss) per share, we do not provide guidance on an earnings/(loss) per share basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses. \\n \\n Adjusted Effective Tax Rate (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Effective Tax Rate) Measure of Company s tax rate excluding pre-tax special items (described above) and tax special items. The measure provides an ongoing effective rate which investors find useful for historical comparisons and for forecasting. When we provide guidance for adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide guidance on an effective tax rate basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses. \\n 75 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Company Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Cash Provided By/(Used In) Operating Activities) Measure of Company s operating cash flow excluding Ford Credit s operating cash flows. The measure contains elements management considers operating activities, including Company excluding Ford Credit capital spending, Ford Credit distributions to its parent, and settlement of derivatives. The measure excludes cash outflows for funded pension contributions, restructuring actions, and other items that are considered operating cash flows under U.S. GAAP. This measure is useful to management and investors because it is consistent with management s assessment of the Company s operating cash flow performance. When we provide guidance for Company adjusted free cash flow, we do not provide guidance for net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities because the GAAP measure will include items that are difficult to quantify or predict with reasonable certainty, including cash flows related to the Company's exposures to foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices (separate from any related hedges), Ford Credit's operating cash flows, and cash flows related to special items, including separation payments, each of which individually or in the aggregate could have a significant impact to our net cash provided by/(used in) our operating activities. \\n \\n Adjusted ROIC Calculated as the sum of adjusted net operating profit/(loss) after cash tax from the last four quarters, divided by the average invested capital over the last four quarters. Adjusted Return on Invested Capital Adjusted ROIC provides management and investors with useful information to evaluate the Company s after-cash tax operating return on its invested capital for the period presented. Adjusted net operating profit/(loss) after cash tax measures operating results less special items, interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), and certain pension/OPEB costs. Average invested capital is the sum of average balance sheet equity, debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), and net pension/OPEB liability. \\n 76 \\n\\nItem 7.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \\n\\nWe consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. \\n \\n Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. \\n \\n Warranties and Field Service Actions \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required. We provide base warranties on the products we sell for specific periods of time and/or mileage, which vary depending upon the type of product and the geographic location of its sale. Separately, we also periodically perform field service actions related to safety recalls, emission recalls, and other product campaigns. Pursuant to these warranties and field service actions, we will repair, replace, or adjust parts on a vehicle that are defective in factory-supplied materials or workmanship. We accrue the estimated cost of both base warranty coverages and field service actions at the time of sale. In addition, from time to time, we issue extended warranties at our expense, the estimated cost of which is accrued at the time of issuance. \\n \\n Assumptions and Approach Used. We establish our estimate of base warranty obligations using a patterned estimation model. We use historical information regarding the nature, frequency, and average cost of claims for each vehicle line by model year. We reevaluate our estimate of base warranty obligations on a regular basis. Experience has shown that initial data for any given model year may be volatile; therefore, our process relies on long-term historical averages until sufficient data are available. With actual experience, we use the data to update the historical averages. We then compare the resulting accruals with present spending rates to assess whether the balances are adequate to meet expected future obligations. Based on this data, we update our estimates as necessary. \\n \\n Field service actions may occur in periods beyond the base warranty coverage period. We establish our estimates of field service action obligations using a patterned estimation model. We use historical information regarding the nature, frequency, severity, and average cost of claims for each model year. We assess our obligation for field service actions on a regular basis using actual claims experience and update our estimates as necessary. \\n \\n Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors used in establishing our estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 25 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for information regarding warranty and field service action costs. \\n \\n Pensions and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required. The estimation of our defined benefit pension and OPEB plan obligations and expenses requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events, such as demographic experience and health care cost increases. Plan obligations and expenses are based on existing retirement plan provisions. No assumption is made regarding any potential future changes to benefit provisions beyond those to which we are presently committed (e.g., in existing labor contracts). \\n 83 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Assumptions and Approach Used. The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: \\n \\n Discount rates. Our discount rate assumptions are based primarily on the results of cash flow matching analyses, which match the future cash outflows for each major plan to a yield curve based on high-quality bonds specific to the country of the plan. Benefit payments are discounted at the rates on the curve to determine the year-end obligations. \\n \\n Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Our expected long-term rate of return considers inputs from a range of advisors for capital market returns, adjusted for specific aspects of our investment strategy by plan. Historical returns also are considered when appropriate. The assumption is based on consideration of all inputs, with a focus on long-term trends to avoid short-term market influences. \\n \\n Salary growth. Our salary growth assumption reflects our actual experience, long-term outlook, and assumed inflation. \\n \\n Inflation. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators, including real gross domestic product growth and central bank inflation targets. \\n \\n Expected contributions. Our expected amount and timing of contributions are based on an assessment of minimum requirements, cash availability, and other considerations (e.g., funded status, avoidance of regulatory premiums and levies, and tax efficiency). \\n \\n Retirement rates. Retirement rates are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience. \\n \\n Mortality rates. Mortality rates are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience. \\n \\n Health care cost trends . Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook, and an assessment of likely long-term trends. \\n \\n Assumptions are set at each year-end and are generally not changed during the year unless there is a major plan event, such as a curtailment or settlement that would trigger a plan remeasurement. \\n \\n See Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding pension and OPEB costs and assumptions. \\n \\n Pension Plans \\n \\n Effect of Actual Results . The year-end 2023 weighted average discount rate was 5.17 for U.S. plans and 3.98 for non-U.S. plans, reflecting decreases of 34 and 44 basis points, respectively, compared with year-end 2022. In 2023, the U.S. actual return on assets was 7.41 , which was higher than the expected long-term rate of return of 6.25 . Non-U.S. actual return on assets was 5.56 , which was higher than the expected long-term rate of return of 4.13 . The higher returns are explained primarily by gains on fixed income assets. In total, lower discount rates compared to year-end 2022, partially offset by asset gains in excess of our assumptions resulted in a net remeasurement loss of 1.8 billion, which has been recognized within net periodic benefit cost and reported as a special item. \\n \\n For 2024, the expected long-term rate of return on assets is 5.93 for U.S. plans, down 32 basis points from 2023, reflecting lower capital market return expectations, and 4.53 for non-U.S. plans, up 40 basis points compared with a year ago, reflecting return expectations in those markets and a higher return seeking mix for certain plans. \\n \\n De-risking Strategy . We employ a broad de-risking strategy for our global funded plans that increases the matching characteristics of our assets relative to our obligation as funded status improves. Changes in interest rates, which directly influence changes in discount rates, in addition to other factors have a significant impact on the value of our pension obligation and fixed income asset portfolio. Our de-risking strategy has increased the allocation to fixed income investments and reduced our funded status sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates should result in offsetting effects in the value of our pension obligation and the value of the fixed income asset portfolio. \\n 84 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Sensitivity Analysis. The December 31, 2023 pension funded status and 2024 expense are affected by year-end 2023 assumptions. Sensitivities to these assumptions may be asymmetric and are specific to the time periods noted. The effects of changes in the factors that generally have the largest impact on year-end funded status and pension expense are discussed below. \\n \\n Discount rates and interest rates have the largest impact on our obligations and fixed income assets. The table below estimates the effect on our funded status of an increase/decrease in discount rates and interest rates (in millions): Basis Point Change Increase/(Decrease) in \\n December 31, 2023 Funded Status \\n Factor U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans Discount rate - obligation +/- 100 bps 2,900/ (3,400) 2,700/ (3,400) Interest rate - fixed income assets +/- 100 (2,800)/3,200 (1,800)/2,200 Net impact on funded status 100/ (200) 900/ (1,200) \\n \\n The fixed income asset sensitivity shown excludes other fixed income return components (e.g., changes in credit spreads, bond coupon and active management excess returns), and growth asset returns. Other factors that affect net funded status (e.g., contributions) are not reflected. \\n \\n Interest rates and the expected long-term rate of return on assets have the largest effect on pension expense. These assumptions are generally set at each year-end for expense recorded throughout the following year. The table below estimates the effect on pension expense of a higher/lower assumption for these factors (in millions): Basis Point Change Increase/(Decrease) in 2024 Pension Expense Factor U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans Interest rate - service cost and interest cost +/- 25 bps 25/ (25) 15/ (15) Expected long-term rate of return on assets +/- 25 (75)/75 (55)/55 \\n \\n The effect of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities. The sensitivity of pension expense to a change in discount rate assumptions may not be linear. \\n \\n Other Postretirement Employee Benefits \\n \\n Effect of Actual Results . The weighted average discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation for worldwide OPEB plans at December 31, 2023 was 5.10 , compared with 5.48 at December 31, 2022, resulting in a worldwide net remeasurement loss of 286 million, which has been recognized within net periodic benefit cost and reported as a special item. \\n \\n Sensitivity Analysis. Discount rates and interest rates have the largest effect on our OPEB obligation and expense. The table below estimates the effect on 2024 OPEB expense of higher/lower assumptions for these factors (in millions): Worldwide OPEB Basis Point Change (Increase)/Decrease 2023 YE Obligation Increase/(Decrease) 2024 Expense Factor Discount rate - obligation +/- 100 bps 450/ (540) N/A Interest rate - service cost and interest cost +/- 25 N/A 5/ (5) \\n \\n Income Taxes \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required. We must make estimates and apply judgment in determining the provision for income taxes for financial reporting purposes. We make these estimates and judgments primarily in the following areas: (i) the calculation of tax credits, (ii) the calculation of differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax reporting and financial statement purposes, as well as (iii) the calculation of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Changes in these estimates and judgments may result in a material increase or decrease to our tax provision, which would be recorded in the period in which the change occurs. \\n 85 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Assumptions and Approach Used. We are subject to the income tax laws and regulations of the many jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws and regulations are complex and involve uncertainties in the application to our facts and circumstances that may be open to interpretation. We recognize benefits for these uncertain tax positions based upon a process that requires judgment regarding the technical application of the laws, regulations, and various related judicial opinions. If, in our judgment, it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50 that the uncertain tax position will be settled favorably for us, we estimate an amount that ultimately will be realized. This process is inherently subjective since it requires our assessment of the probability of future outcomes. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis, including consideration of changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial opinions, as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. Changes to our estimate of the amount to be realized are recorded in our provision for income taxes during the period in which the change occurred. \\n \\n We must also assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income and reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized. \\n \\n This assessment, which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis, takes into account various types of evidence, including the following: \\n \\n Nature, frequency, and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses. A pattern of objectively measured recent financial reporting losses is heavily weighted as a source of negative evidence. We generally consider cumulative pre-tax losses in the three-year period ending with the current quarter to be significant negative evidence regarding future profitability. We also consider the strength and trend of earnings, as well as other relevant factors. In certain circumstances, historical information may not be as relevant due to changes in our business operations; \\n \\n Sources of future taxable income. Future reversals of existing temporary differences are heavily weighted sources of objectively verifiable positive evidence. Projections of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences are a source of positive evidence only when the projections are combined with a history of recent profits and can be reasonably estimated. Otherwise, these projections are considered inherently subjective and generally will not be sufficient to overcome negative evidence that includes relevant cumulative losses in recent years, particularly if the projected future taxable income is dependent on an anticipated turnaround to profitability that has not yet been achieved. In such cases, we generally give these projections of future taxable income no weight for the purposes of our valuation allowance assessment; and \\n \\n Tax planning strategies. If necessary and available, tax planning strategies could be implemented to accelerate taxable amounts to utilize expiring carryforwards. These strategies would be a source of additional positive evidence and, depending on their nature, could be heavily weighted. \\n \\n In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider the trade-offs between cash preservation and cash outlays to preserve tax credits. We presently believe that global valuation allowances of 4.2 billion are required and that we ultimately will recover the remaining 16 billion of deferred tax assets. However, the ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets is subject to a number of variables, including our future profitability within relevant tax jurisdictions, and future tax planning and the related effects on our cash and liquidity position. Accordingly, our valuation allowances may increase or decrease in future periods. \\n \\n For additional information regarding income taxes, see Note 7 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. \\n 86 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Impairment of Long-Lived Assets \\n \\n Asset groups are tested at the level of the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Asset groupings for impairment analysis are reevaluated when events occur, such as changes in organizational structure and management reporting. Following the organizational and segment structure change in the beginning of 2023, our asset groups are: Ford Blue North America, Ford Blue Europe, Ford Blue Rest of World, Ford Model e, Ford Pro, Ford Credit, and Ford Next. \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required - Held-and-Used Long-Lived Assets. We test our long-lived asset groups when changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable. Events that trigger a test for recoverability include material adverse changes in projected revenues or expenses, present cash flow losses combined with a history of cash flow losses and a forecast that demonstrates significant continuing losses, significant negative industry or economic trends (including a substantial shift in consumer preference), a current expectation that a long-lived asset group will be disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life, a significant adverse change in the manner in which an asset group is used or in its physical condition, or when there is a change in the asset grouping. In addition, investing in new, emerging products (e.g., EVs) or services (e.g., connectivity) may require substantial upfront investment, which may result in initial forecasted negative cash flows in the near term. In these instances, near-term negative cash flows on their own may not be indicative of a triggering event for evaluation of impairment. In such circumstances, we also conduct a qualitative evaluation of the business growth trajectory, which includes updating our assessment of when positive cash flows are expected to be generated, confirming whether established milestones are being achieved, and assessing our ability and intent to continue to access required funding to execute the plan. If this evaluation indicates a triggering event has occurred, a test for recoverability is performed. \\n \\n When a triggering event occurs, a test for recoverability is performed, comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group. If the undiscounted forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, the asset group s fair value is measured relying primarily on a discounted cash flow method. To the extent available, we will also consider third-party valuations of our long-lived assets that were prepared for other business purposes. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value. When an impairment loss is recognized for assets to be held and used, the adjusted carrying amounts of those assets are depreciated over their remaining useful life. \\n \\n Assumptions and Approach Used - Held-and-Used Long-Lived Assets. The fair value of an asset group is determined from the perspective of a market-participant considering, among other things, appropriate discount rates, valuation techniques, the most advantageous market, and assumptions about the highest and best use of the asset group. \\n \\n We measure the fair value of an asset group based on market prices (i.e., the amount for which the asset could be sold to a third party) when available. When market prices are not available, we generally estimate the fair value of the asset group using the income approach and/or the market approach. The income approach uses cash flow projections. Inherent in our development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results, business plan forecasts, expected growth rates, and cost of capital, similar to those a market participant would use to assess fair value. We also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions and other data. Many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management, and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods. \\n \\n Changes in assumptions or estimates can materially affect the fair value measurement of an asset group and, therefore, can affect the test results. The following are key assumptions we use in making cash flow projections: \\n \\n Business projections. We make assumptions about the demand for our products in the marketplace. These \\n assumptions drive our planning assumptions for volume, mix, and pricing. We also make assumptions about our cost levels (e.g., capacity utilization, cost performance). These projections are derived using our internal business plan forecasts that are updated at least annually and reviewed by our Board of Directors. \\n \\n Long-term growth rate. A growth rate is used to calculate the terminal value of the business and is added to the present value of the debt-free interim cash flows. The growth rate is the expected rate at which an asset group s earnings stream is projected to grow beyond the planning period. \\n \\n Discount rate. When measuring possible impairment, future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted-average cost of capital that we anticipate a potential market participant would use. Weighted-average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall risk-adjusted pre-tax rate of return expected by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise. \\n 87 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Economic projections. Assumptions regarding general economic conditions are included in and affect our assumptions regarding industry sales and pricing estimates for our vehicles. These macroeconomic assumptions include, but are not limited to, industry sales volumes, inflation, interest rates, prices of raw materials (e.g., commodities), and foreign currency exchange rates. \\n \\n The market approach is another method for measuring the fair value of an asset group. This approach relies on the market value (i.e., market capitalization) of companies that are engaged in the same or a similar line of business as the asset group being evaluated. In addition, to the extent available we also consider third-party valuations that were prepared for other business purposes. \\n \\n During 2023, we identified triggering events related to our Ford Blue Europe asset group. In each situation in which we experienced a triggering event during the year, we tested our long-lived assets for impairment using our internal economic and business projections, and determined that the carrying values of the long-lived assets were recoverable. If, in future quarters, our economic or business projections were to change as a result of an update to our plans, a deterioration of the economic or business environment, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used, or an expectation that a long-lived asset group will be disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life, we would undertake additional testing, as appropriate, which could result in an impairment of long-lived assets. \\n\\nAllowance for Credit Losses \\n \\n The allowance for credit losses represents Ford Credit s estimate of the expected lifetime credit losses inherent in finance receivables as of the balance sheet date. The adequacy of Ford Credit s allowance for credit losses is assessed quarterly, and the assumptions and models used in establishing the allowance are evaluated regularly. Because credit losses can vary substantially over time, estimating credit losses requires a number of assumptions about matters that are uncertain. Changes in assumptions affect Ford Credit interest, operating, and other expenses on our consolidated income statements and the allowance for credit losses contained within Ford Credit finance receivables, net on our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding allowance for credit losses. \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required. Ford Credit estimates the allowance for credit losses for receivables that share similar risk characteristics based on a collective assessment using a combination of measurement models and management judgment. The models consider factors such as historical trends in credit losses, recent portfolio performance, and forward-looking macroeconomic conditions. The models vary by portfolio and receivable type including consumer finance receivables, wholesale loans, and dealer loans. If Ford Credit does not believe the models reflect lifetime expected credit losses for the portfolio, an adjustment is made to reflect management judgment regarding qualitative factors, including economic uncertainty, observable changes in portfolio performance, and other relevant factors. \\n\\n88 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Assumptions Used. Ford Credit s allowance for credit losses is based on its assumptions regarding: \\n \\n Probability of default . The expected probability of payment and time to default, which include assumptions about macroeconomic factors and recent performance; and \\n Loss given default. The percentage of the expected balance due at default that is not recoverable. The loss given default takes into account expected collateral value and future recoveries. \\n \\n Macroeconomic factors used in Ford Credit s models are country specific and include variables such as unemployment rates, personal bankruptcy filings, housing prices, and gross domestic product. \\n \\n Sensitivity Analysis. Changes in the probability of default and loss given default assumptions would affect the allowance for credit losses. The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions for Ford Credit s U.S. Ford and Lincoln retail financing is as follows (in millions): Assumption Basis Point Change \\n Increase/(Decrease) Probability of default (lifetime) +/- 100 bps 230/ (230) Loss given default +/- 100 10/(10) \\n \\n Accumulated Depreciation on Vehicles Subject to Operating Leases \\n \\n Accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases reduces the value of the leased vehicles in Ford Credit s operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their expected residual value at the end of the lease term. \\n \\n Ford Credit monitors residual values each month, and it reviews the adequacy of accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis. If Ford Credit believes that the expected residual values for its vehicles have changed, it revises depreciation to ensure that net investment in operating leases (equal to the acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation) will be adjusted to reflect Ford Credit s revised estimate of the expected residual value at the end of the lease term. Adjustments to depreciation expense result in a change in the depreciation rates of the vehicles subject to operating leases and are recorded prospectively on a straight-line basis. \\n \\n Generally, lease customers have the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer. \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required. Each operating lease in Ford Credit s portfolio represents a vehicle it owns that has been leased to a customer. At the time Ford Credit purchases a lease, it establishes an expected residual value for the vehicle. Ford Credit estimates the expected residual value by evaluating recent auction values, return volumes for its leased vehicles, industrywide used vehicle prices, marketing incentive plans, and vehicle quality data. \\n \\n Assumptions Used. Ford Credit s accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases is based on assumptions regarding: \\n \\n Auction value. Ford Credit s projection of the market value of the vehicles when sold at the end of the lease; and \\n Return volume. Ford Credit s projection of the number of vehicles that will be returned at lease-end. \\n \\n See Note 12 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases. \\n\\n89 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Sensitivity Analysis. For returned vehicles, Ford Credit faces a risk that the amount it obtains from the vehicle sold at auction will be less than its estimate of the expected residual value for the vehicle. The impact of the change in assumptions on future auction values and return volumes would increase or decrease accumulated supplemental depreciation and depreciation expense over the remaining terms of the operating leases; however, the impact may be tempered or exacerbated based on future auction values in relation to the purchase price specified in the lease contract. A change in the assumption for an auction value will impact Ford Credit s estimate of accumulated supplemental depreciation if the future auction value is lower than the purchase price specified in the lease contract. The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions for Ford Credit s U.S. Ford and Lincoln operating lease portfolio is as follows (in millions): Assumption Basis Point \\n Change \\n Increase/(Decrease) Future auction values +/- 100 bps (20)/ 20 Return volumes +/- 100 5/(5) \\n \\n Adjustments to the amount of accumulated supplemental depreciation on operating leases are reflected on our balance sheets as Net investment in operating leases and on our income statements in Ford Credit interest, operating, and other expenses. \\n\\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS ISSUED BUT NOT YET ADOPTED \\n \\n For a discussion of recent accounting standards, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. \\n \\n 90  \n",
      "1  ITEM 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \\n\\nKey Trends and Economic Factors Affecting Ford and the Automotive Industry \\n \\n COVID-19 and Supplier Disruptions. The impact of COVID-19, including changes in consumer behavior, pandemic fears and market downturns, and restrictions on business and individual activities, has created significant volatility in the global economy. Outbreaks in certain regions continue to cause intermittent COVID-19-related disruptions in our supply chain and local manufacturing operations. We also continue to face supplier disruptions due to labor shortages and other production issues, in addition to the continuing semiconductor shortage. Our inconsistent production schedule has been disruptive to our suppliers operations, which, in turn, has led to higher costs and production shortfalls. Further, actions taken by Russia in Ukraine have impacted and could further impact our suppliers, particularly our lower tier suppliers, as well as our operations in Europe. For additional information on the impact of supplier disruptions, see the Outlook section on page 73 . \\n \\n Currency Exchange Rate Volatility. After aggressively easing monetary policy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve, and other central banks around the world, in 2022 began to withdraw monetary stimulus by raising interest rates. Periods of monetary policy tightening are often associated with heightened financial market and currency volatility, especially for those markets that are outliers in terms of their economic or monetary policy backdrop. This is notable for many emerging markets, which may also face increased exposure to commodity prices and political instability, contributing to unpredictable movements in the value of their exchange rates. In addition to direct impacts on the financial flows of global automotive companies, currency movements can also impact pricing of vehicles exported to overseas markets. In most markets, exchange rates are market-determined, and all are impacted by many different macroeconomic and policy factors, and thus likely to remain volatile. However, in some markets, exchange rates are heavily influenced or controlled by governments. \\n \\n Pricing Pressure. Over the last year, prices of both new and used vehicles have increased substantially due to strong demand, supply shortages, and inflationary costs. We have already observed some moderation in the rate of price increases as auto production slowly recovers from the semiconductor shortage, but it is unclear whether prices will decline fully to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. Over the long term, intense competition and excess capacity are likely to put downward pressure on inflation-adjusted prices for similarly-contented vehicles and contribute to a challenging pricing environment for the automotive industry in most major markets. \\n \\n Commodity and Energy Prices. Prices for commodities remain volatile. In some cases, spot prices for various commodities have recently diverged somewhat, as anticipated weakening in global industrial activity mitigates price increases for base metals such as steel and aluminum, while precious metals (e.g., palladium), and raw materials that are used in batteries for electric vehicles (e.g., lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, among other materials, for batteries) remain high. The net impact on us and our suppliers has been higher material costs overall. To help ensure supply of raw materials for critical components (e.g., batteries), we, like others in the industry, have entered into multi-year sourcing agreements and may enter into additional agreements. Similar dynamics are impacting energy markets, with Europe particularly exposed to the risk of both higher prices and constraints on supply of natural gas due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Such shortages may impact facilities operated by us or our suppliers, which could have an impact on us in Europe and other regions. In the long term, the outcome of de-carbonization and electrification of the vehicle fleet may depress oil demand, but the global energy transition will also contribute to ongoing volatility of oil and other energy prices. For additional information on commodity costs, see the Outlook section on page 73 . \\n \\n Vehicle Profitability. Our financial results depend on the profitability of the vehicles we sell, which may vary significantly by vehicle line. In general, larger vehicles tend to command higher prices and be more profitable than smaller vehicles, both across and within vehicle segments. For example, in North America, our larger, more profitable vehicles had an average contribution margin that was 120 of our total average contribution margin across all vehicles, whereas our smaller vehicles had significantly lower contribution margins. In addition, government regulations aimed at reducing emissions and increasing fuel efficiency (e.g., ZEV mandates and low emission zones), and other factors that accelerate the transition to electrified vehicles, may increase the cost of vehicles by more than the perceived benefit to consumers and dampen margins. \\n\\n35 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Trade Policy. To the extent governments in various regions implement or intensify barriers to imports, such as erecting tariff or non-tariff barriers or manipulating their currency, and provide advantages to local exporters selling into the global marketplace, there can be a significant negative impact on manufacturers based in other markets. While we believe the long-term trend will support the growth of free trade, we will continue to monitor and address developing issues. \\n \\n Inflation and Interest Rates. We continue to see near-term impacts on our business due to inflation, including ongoing global price pressures in the wake of Russia s invasion of Ukraine, driving up energy prices, freight premiums, and other operating costs above normal rates. Although headline inflation in the United States and Europe appears to have peaked, as gasoline and natural gas prices recede from the latest spike, core inflation (excluding food and energy prices) remains elevated and is a source of continued cost pressure on businesses and households. Interest rates have increased significantly as central banks in developed countries attempt to subdue inflation while government deficits and debt remain at high levels in many global markets. Accordingly, the eventual implications of higher government deficits and debt, tighter monetary policy, and potentially higher long-term interest rates may drive a higher cost of capital for the business. At Ford Credit, rising interest rates may impact its ability to source funding and offer financing at competitive rates, which could reduce its financing margin. \\n \\n Revenue \\n \\n Our Automotive segment revenue is generated primarily by sales of vehicles, parts, and accessories. Revenue is recorded when control is transferred to our customers (generally, our dealers and distributors). For the majority of sales, this occurs when products are shipped from our manufacturing facilities. However, we defer a portion of the consideration received when there is a separate future or stand-ready performance obligation, such as extended service contracts or ongoing vehicle connectivity. Revenue related to extended service contracts is recognized over the term of the agreement in proportion to the costs we expect to incur in satisfying the contract obligations; revenue related to other future or stand-ready performance obligations is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the period in which services are expected to be performed. Vehicles sold to daily rental car companies with an obligation to repurchase for a guaranteed amount, exercisable at the option of the customer, are accounted for as operating leases, with lease revenue recognized over the term of the lease. Proceeds from the sale of vehicles at auction are recognized in revenue upon transfer of control of the vehicle to the buyer. \\n \\n Most of the vehicles sold by us to our dealers and distributors are financed at wholesale by Ford Credit. Upon Ford Credit originating the wholesale receivable related to a dealer s purchase of a vehicle, Ford Credit pays cash to the relevant Automotive legal entity in payment of the dealer s obligation for the purchase price of the vehicle. The dealer then pays the wholesale finance receivable to Ford Credit when it sells the vehicle to a retail customer. \\n \\n Our Ford Credit segment revenue is generated primarily from interest on finance receivables and revenue from operating leases. Revenue from interest on finance receivables is recognized over the term of the receivable using the interest method and includes the amortization of certain deferred origination costs. Revenue from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. \\n \\n Transactions between our Automotive and Ford Credit segments occur in the ordinary course of business. For example, we offer special retail financing and lease incentives to dealers customers who choose to finance or lease our vehicles from Ford Credit. The cost for these incentives is included in our estimate of variable consideration at the date the related vehicle sales to our dealers are recorded. In order to compensate Ford Credit for the lower interest or lease payments offered to the retail customer, we pay the discounted value of the incentive directly to Ford Credit when it originates the retail finance or lease contract with the dealer s customer. Ford Credit recognizes the incentive amount over the life of retail finance contracts as an element of financing revenue and over the life of lease contracts as a reduction to depreciation. See Note 1 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of transactions between our Automotive and Ford Credit segments. \\n\\n36 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Costs and Expenses \\n \\n Our income statement classifies our Company excluding Ford Credit total costs and expenses into two categories: (i) cost of sales, and (ii) selling, administrative, and other expenses. We include within cost of sales those costs related to the development, production, and distribution of our vehicles, parts, accessories, and services. Specifically, we include in cost of sales each of the following: material costs (including commodity costs); freight costs; warranty, including product recall costs; labor and other costs related to the development and production of our vehicles and connectivity, parts, accessories, and services; depreciation and amortization; and other associated costs. We include within selling, administrative, and other expenses labor and other costs not directly related to the development and production of our vehicles, parts, accessories, and services, including such expenses as advertising and sales promotion costs. \\n \\n Certain of our costs, such as material costs, generally vary directly with changes in volume and mix of production. In our industry, production volume often varies significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. Quarterly production volumes experience seasonal shifts throughout the year (including peak retail sales seasons and the impact on production of model changeover and new product launches). Annual production volumes are heavily impacted by external economic factors, including the pace of economic growth and factors such as the availability of consumer credit and cost of fuel. \\n \\n As a result, we analyze the profit impact of certain cost changes holding constant present-year volume and mix and currency exchange, in order to evaluate our cost trends absent the impact of varying production and currency exchange levels. We analyze these cost changes in the following categories: \\n \\n Contribution Costs these costs typically vary with production volume. These costs include material (including commodity), warranty, and freight and duty costs. \\n \\n Structural Costs these costs typically do not have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume. These costs include manufacturing; vehicle and software engineering; spending-related; advertising and sales promotion; administrative, information technology, and selling; and pension and OPEB costs. \\n \\n While contribution costs generally vary directly in proportion to production volume, elements within our structural costs category are impacted to differing degrees by changes in production volume. We also have varying degrees of discretion when it comes to controlling the different elements within our structural costs. For example, depreciation and amortization expense largely is associated with prior capital spending decisions. On the other hand, while labor costs do not vary directly with production volume, manufacturing labor costs may be impacted by changes in volume, for example when we increase overtime, add a production shift, or add personnel to support volume increases. Other structural costs, such as advertising or engineering costs, do not necessarily have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume. Our structural costs generally are within our discretion, although to varying degrees, and can be adjusted over time in response to external factors. \\n \\n We consider certain structural costs to be a direct investment in future growth and revenue. For example, structural costs are necessary to grow our business and improve profitability, invest in new products and technologies, respond to increasing industry sales volume, and grow our market share. \\n \\n Cost of sales and Selling, administrative, and other expenses for full year 2022 were 145.3 billion. Our Automotive segment s material and commodity costs make up the largest portion of these costs and expenses, followed by structural costs. Although material costs are our largest absolute cost, our margins can be affected significantly by changes in any category of costs. \\n 37 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 2022 \\n \\n The net loss attributable to Ford Motor Company was 1,981 million in 2022.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Definitions and Information Regarding Automotive Causal Factors \\n \\n In general, we measure year-over-year change in Automotive segment EBIT using the causal factors listed below, with net pricing and cost variances calculated at present-year volume and mix and exchange: \\n \\n Market Factors (exclude the impact of unconsolidated affiliate wholesale units): \\n Volume and Mix primarily measures EBIT variance from changes in wholesale unit volumes (at prior-year average contribution margin per unit) driven by changes in industry volume, market share, and dealer stocks, as well as the EBIT variance resulting from changes in product mix, including mix among vehicle lines and mix of trim levels and options within a vehicle line \\n Net Pricing primarily measures EBIT variance driven by changes in wholesale unit prices to dealers and marketing incentive programs such as rebate programs, low-rate financing offers, special lease offers, and stock adjustments on dealer inventory \\n \\n Cost: \\n Contribution Costs primarily measures EBIT variance driven by per-unit changes in cost categories that typically vary with volume, such as material costs (including commodity and component costs), warranty expense, and freight and duty costs \\n Structural Costs primarily measures EBIT variance driven by absolute change in cost categories that typically do not have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume. Structural costs include the following cost categories: \\n Manufacturing, Including Volume-Related - consists primarily of costs for hourly and salaried manufacturing personnel, plant overhead (such as utilities and taxes), and new product launch expense. These costs could be affected by volume for operating pattern actions such as overtime, line-speed, and shift schedules \\n Engineering and Connectivity consists primarily of costs for vehicle and software engineering personnel, prototype materials, testing, and outside engineering and software services \\n Spending-Related consists primarily of depreciation and amortization of our manufacturing and engineering assets, but also includes asset retirements and operating leases \\n Advertising and Sales Promotions includes costs for advertising, marketing programs, brand promotions, customer mailings and promotional events, and auto shows \\n Administrative, Information Technology, and Selling includes primarily costs for salaried personnel and purchased services related to our staff activities, information technology, and selling functions \\n Pension and OPEB consists primarily of past service pension costs and other postretirement employee benefit costs \\n \\n Exchange primarily measures EBIT variance driven by one or more of the following: (i) transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the relevant entities, (ii) effects of converting functional currency income to U.S. dollars, (iii) effects of remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities of the relevant entities in currencies other than their functional currency, or (iv) results of our foreign currency hedging \\n \\n Other includes a variety of items, such as parts and services earnings, royalties, government incentives, and compensation-related changes \\n \\n In addition, definitions and calculations used in this report include: \\n \\n Wholesales and Revenue wholesale unit volumes include all Ford and Lincoln badged units (whether produced by Ford or by an unconsolidated affiliate) that are sold to dealerships or others, units manufactured by Ford that are sold to other manufacturers, units distributed by Ford for other manufacturers, and local brand units produced by our China joint venture, Jiangling Motors Corporation, Ltd. JMC ), that are sold to dealerships or others. Vehicles sold to daily rental car companies that are subject to a guaranteed repurchase option (i.e., rental repurchase), as well as other sales of finished vehicles for which the recognition of revenue is deferred (e.g., consignments), also are included in wholesale unit volumes. Revenue from certain vehicles in wholesale unit volumes (specifically, Ford badged vehicles produced and distributed by our unconsolidated affiliates, as well as JMC brand vehicles) are not included in our revenue \\n \\n Industry Volume and Market Share based, in part, on estimated vehicle registrations; includes medium and heavy duty trucks \\n \\n SAAR seasonally adjusted annual rate \\n 45 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Mobility Segment \\n \\n The Mobility segment primarily includes development costs for Ford s autonomous vehicles and related businesses, Ford s equity ownership in Argo AI (a developer of autonomous driving systems), and other mobility businesses and investments. \\n \\n In our Mobility segment, our 2022 EBIT loss improved 104 million from a year ago. The 926 million EBIT loss reflects our strategic investments in our autonomous vehicle capabilities and support of our mobility initiatives. \\n \\n In the third quarter of 2022, we made the strategic decision to shift our capital spending from L4 technology being developed by Argo AI to advanced L2/L3 systems, which we believe will ultimately be essential to achieve profitable commercialization of L4 autonomy at scale in the future. Additionally, because of the significant additional capital and time required to achieve commercialization of L4, as well as other macroeconomic factors, Argo AI has been unable to attract new investors. After performing external outreach in the third quarter to assess market interest in acquiring either Argo AI or its technology components and conducting internal reviews to evaluate opportunities to leverage Argo AI s technology, Ford determined that Argo AI no longer has value as a going concern. As a result, we reassessed the carrying value of our investment in Argo AI starting from September 30, 2022, and in October, Ford and VW initiated the process of exiting the joint development of L4 technology through Argo AI. Accordingly, in the second half of 2022, we recorded as a special item a 2.7 billion pre-tax impairment on our Argo AI investment, and on October 26, 2022, we announced that Argo AI plans to wind down operations, which is in progress. \\n \\n 46 \\n\\nItem 7.

Ford Credit s loss metrics reflected healthy and stable consumer credit conditions and strong auction values. Ford Credit s U.S. 36-month auction values for off-lease vehicles were up 8 from a year ago, reflecting strong demand for used vehicles, including the impact of lower new vehicle production due to the semiconductor shortage. We are planning for full year 2023 auction values to decrease as supply constraints improve. \\n \\n Ford Credit s 2022 EBT of 2,657 million was 2,060 million lower than a year ago, reflecting lower credit loss and lease residual reserve releases, lower financing margin, and lower lease return rates. \\n \\n 47 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Definitions and Information Regarding Ford Credit Causal Factors \\n \\n In general, we measure year-over-year changes in Ford Credit s EBT using the causal factors listed below: \\n \\n Volume and Mix: \\n Volume primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by changes in average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses at prior period financing margin yield (defined below in financing margin) at prior period exchange rates. Volume changes are primarily driven by the volume of new and used vehicles sold and leased, the extent to which Ford Credit purchases retail financing and operating lease contracts, the extent to which Ford Credit provides wholesale financing, the sales price of the vehicles financed, the level of dealer inventories, Ford-sponsored special financing programs available exclusively through Ford Credit, and the availability of cost-effective funding \\n Mix primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by period-over-period changes in the composition of Ford Credit s average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses by product within each region \\n \\n Financing Margin: \\n Financing margin variance is the period-to-period change in financing margin yield multiplied by the present period average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses at prior period exchange rates. This calculation is performed at the product and country level and then aggregated. Financing margin yield equals revenue, less interest expense and scheduled depreciation for the period, divided by average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses for the same period \\n Financing margin changes are driven by changes in revenue and interest expense. Changes in revenue are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, cost assumptions in pricing, mix of business, and competitive environment. Changes in interest expense are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, borrowing spreads, and asset-liability management \\n \\n Credit Loss: \\n Credit loss is the change in the provision for credit losses at prior period exchange rates. For analysis purposes, management splits the provision for credit losses into net charge-offs and the change in the allowance for credit losses \\n Net charge-off changes are primarily driven by the number of repossessions, severity per repossession, and recoveries. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are primarily driven by changes in historical trends in credit losses and recoveries, changes in the composition and size of Ford Credit s present portfolio, changes in trends in historical used vehicle values, and changes in forward looking macroeconomic conditions. For additional information, refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates - Allowance for Credit Losses section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2022 Form 10-K Report \\n \\n Lease Residual: \\n Lease residual measures changes to residual performance at prior period exchange rates. For analysis purposes, management splits residual performance primarily into residual gains and losses, and the change in accumulated supplemental depreciation \\n Residual gain and loss changes are primarily driven by the number of vehicles returned to Ford Credit and sold, and the difference between the auction value and the depreciated value (which includes both base and accumulated supplemental depreciation) of the vehicles sold. Changes in accumulated supplemental depreciation are primarily driven by changes in Ford Credit s estimate of the expected auction value at the end of the lease term, and changes in Ford Credit s estimate of the number of vehicles that will be returned to it and sold. Depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases includes early termination losses on operating leases due to customer default events. For additional information, refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates - Accumulated Depreciation on Vehicles Subject to Operating Leases section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2022 Form 10-K Report \\n \\n Exchange: \\n Reflects changes in EBT driven by the effects of converting functional currency income to U.S. dollars \\n \\n Other: \\n Primarily includes operating expenses, other revenue, insurance expenses, and other income/(loss) at prior period exchange rates \\n Changes in operating expenses are primarily driven by salaried personnel costs, facilities costs, and costs associated with the origination and servicing of customer contracts \\n In general, other income/(loss) changes are primarily driven by changes in earnings related to market valuation adjustments to derivatives (primarily related to movements in interest rates) and other miscellaneous items \\n 48 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n In addition, the following definitions and calculations apply to Ford Credit when used in this Report: \\n \\n Cash (as shown in the Funding Structure and Liquidity tables) Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, excluding amounts related to insurance activities \\n \\n Debt (as shown in the Key Metrics and Leverage tables) Debt on Ford Credit s balance sheets. Includes debt issued in securitizations and payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets and related enhancements. Ford Credit holds the right to receive the excess cash flows not needed to pay the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions \\n \\n Earnings Before Taxes EBT Reflects Ford Credit s income before income taxes \\n \\n Loss-to-Receivables LTR Ratio LTR ratio is calculated using net charge-offs divided by average finance receivables, excluding unearned interest supplements and the allowance for credit losses \\n \\n Return on Equity ROE (as shown in the Key Metrics table) Reflects return on equity calculated by annualizing net income for the period and dividing by monthly average equity for the period \\n \\n Securitization and Restricted Cash (as shown in the Liquidity table) Securitization cash is held for the benefit of the securitization investors (for example, a reserve fund). Restricted cash primarily includes cash held to meet certain local governmental and regulatory reserve requirements and cash held under the terms of certain contractual agreements \\n \\n Securitizations (as shown in the Public Term Funding Plan table) Public securitization transactions, Rule 144A offerings sponsored by Ford Credit, and widely distributed offerings by Ford Credit Canada \\n \\n Term Asset-Backed Securities (as shown in the Funding Structure table) Obligations issued in securitization transactions that are payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets and related enhancements \\n \\n Total Net Receivables (as shown in the Key Metrics table) Includes finance receivables (retail financing and wholesale) sold for legal purposes and net investment in operating leases included in securitization transactions that do not satisfy the requirements for accounting sale treatment. These receivables and operating leases are reported on Ford Credit s balance sheets and are available only for payment of the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions; they are not available to pay the other obligations of Ford Credit or the claims of Ford Credit s other creditors \\n\\nCorporate Other \\n \\n Corporate Other primarily includes corporate governance expenses, interest income (excluding interest earned on our extended service contract portfolio that is included in our Automotive segment) and gains and losses from our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding gains and losses on investments in equity securities), and foreign exchange derivatives gains and losses associated with intercompany lending. Corporate governance expenses are primarily administrative, delivering benefit on behalf of the global enterprise, that are not allocated to operating segments. These include expenses related to setting and directing global policy, providing oversight and stewardship, and promoting the Company s interests. For full year 2022, Corporate Other had a 1,008 million loss, compared with a 1,084 million loss in 2021. The improvement was driven by higher Automotive interest income due to higher interest rates (primarily Fed Funds). \\n\\nInterest on Debt \\n \\n Interest on Debt consists of interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit. Our full year 2022 interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit was 1,259 million, 544 million lower than in 2021, primarily explained by U.S. debt restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2021 and during 2022. \\n \\n 49 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Taxes \\n \\n Our Provision for/(Benefit from) income taxes for full year 2022 was a 864 million benefit, resulting in an effective tax rate of 28.6 . This includes benefits arising from the reversal of U.S. valuation allowances, primarily as a result of planning actions. \\n \\n Our full year 2022 adjusted effective tax rate, which excludes special items, was 18.7 . \\n \\n We regularly review our organizational structure and income tax elections for affiliates in non-U.S. and U.S. tax jurisdictions, which may result in changes in affiliates that are included in or excluded from our U.S. tax return. Any future changes to our structure, as well as any changes in income tax laws in the countries that we operate, could cause increases or decreases to our deferred tax balances and related valuation allowances. \\n 50 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 2021 \\n \\n The net income attributable to Ford Motor Company was 17,937 million in 2021. Company adjusted EBIT was 10,000 million. \\n \\n Net income/(loss) includes certain items special items that are excluded from Company adjusted EBIT. These items are discussed in more detail in Note 26 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. We report special items separately to allow investors analyzing our results to identify certain infrequent significant items that they may wish to exclude when considering the trend of ongoing operating results. Our pre-tax and tax special items were as follows (in millions): \\n 2020 2021 Global Redesign Europe (727) (530) India (23) (468) South America (2,486) (803) Russia 18 5 China (including Taiwan) (56) 150 Separations and Other (not included above) (94) (74) Subtotal Global Redesign (3,368) (1,720) Other Items Gain on transaction with Argo AI 3,454 Gain on Rivian IPO and mark-to-market \\n 143 9,096 Gains and losses on investments in equity securities (excl.

The gains were partially offset by costs associated with our Global Redesign actions and a debt extinguishment premium associated with the repurchase and redemption of 7.6 billion of our higher-coupon debt. \\n \\n In Note 26 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, special items are reflected as a separate reconciling item, as opposed to being allocated among the Automotive, Mobility, and Ford Credit segments. This reflects the fact that management excludes these items from its review of operating segment results for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources. \\n 51 \\n\\nItem 7.

Ford Credit s loss metrics reflected healthy and stable consumer credit conditions and strong auction values. Ford Credit s U.S. 36-month auction values for off-lease vehicles were up 26 from 2020, reflecting strong demand for used vehicles, including the impact of lower new vehicle production due to the semiconductor shortage. \\n \\n Ford Credit s 2021 EBT increased 2,109 million from 2020, explained primarily by favorable operating lease residual performance, the non-recurrence of the 2020 increase to the credit loss reserve due to deterioration in macroeconomic conditions related to COVID-19, and reductions in the credit loss reserve in 2021, partially offset by lower volume driven by the impact of the global semiconductor shortage and lower financing margin. \\n 58 \\n\\nItem 7.

The higher loss was driven by lower interest income and higher administrative and IT-related expenses. \\n\\nInterest on Debt \\n \\n Our full year 2021 interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit was 1,803 million, 154 million higher than in 2020, primarily explained by higher U.S. unsecured debt interest expense. \\n\\nTaxes \\n \\n Our Provision for/(Benefit from) income taxes for full year 2021 was a 130 million benefit, resulting in an effective tax rate of negative 0.7 . This includes a benefit of 2.9 billion to recognize deferred tax assets resulting from changes in our global tax structure and a 918 million benefit from the reversal of U.S. valuation allowances. \\n \\n Our full year 2021 adjusted effective tax rate, which excludes special items, was 21.9 . \\n 59 \\n\\nItem 7.

One of our key priorities is to maintain a strong balance sheet, while at the same time having resources available to invest in and grow our business. At December 31, 2022, we had Company cash of 32.3 billion and liquidity of 48.0 billion, including approximately 194 million of Rivian marketable securities. In 2022, we sold approximately 91 million of our Rivian shares resulting in proceeds of about 3 billion. As marketable securities increase or decrease in value, Company cash and liquidity will likewise increase or decrease. At December 31, 2022, about 89 of Company cash was held by consolidated entities domiciled in the United States. \\n \\n To be prepared for an economic downturn, we target an ongoing Company cash balance at or above 20 billion plus significant additional liquidity above our Company cash target. We expect to have periods when we will be above or below this amount due to: (i) future cash flow expectations, such as for investments in future opportunities, capital investments, debt maturities, pension contributions, or restructuring requirements, (ii) short-term timing differences, and (iii) changes in the global economic environment. \\n \\n Our Company cash investments (excluding the Rivian marketable securities) primarily include U.S. Department of Treasury obligations, federal agency securities, bank time deposits with investment-grade institutions, investment-grade corporate securities, investment-grade commercial paper, and debt obligations of a select group of non-U.S. governments, non-U.S. governmental agencies, and supranational institutions. The average maturity of these investments is approximately one year and adjusted based on market conditions and liquidity needs. We monitor our Company cash levels and average maturity on a daily basis. \\n\\n60 \\n\\nItem 7.

Our material cash requirements include: \\n \\n Capital expenditures (for additional information, see the Changes in Company Cash section below) and other payments for engineering, software, product development, and implementation of our plans for electric vehicles \\n \\n Purchase of raw materials and components to support the manufacturing and sale of vehicles (including electric vehicles), parts, and accessories (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table and the accompanying description of our Purchase obligations below) \\n \\n Marketing incentive payments to dealers \\n \\n Payments for warranty and field service actions (for additional information, see Note 25 of the Notes to the Financial Statements) \\n \\n Debt repayments (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table below and Note 19 of the Notes the Financial Statements) \\n \\n Discretionary and mandatory payments to our global pension plans (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table below, the Changes in Company Cash section below, and Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements) \\n \\n Employee wages, benefits, and incentives \\n \\n Operating lease payments (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table below and Note 18 of the Notes to the Financial Statements) \\n \\n Cash effects related to the global redesign of our business (for additional information, see the Changes in Company Cash section below) \\n \\n Strategic acquisitions and investments to grow our business, including electrification \\n \\n Subject to approval by our Board of Directors, shareholder distributions in the form of dividend payments and/or a share repurchase program (including share repurchases to offset the anti-dilutive effect of increased shared-based compensation) may require the expenditure of a material amount of cash. Moreover, we may be subject to additional material cash requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, e.g., legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions, and other matters. \\n \\n We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties, and, as noted above, such commitments require a material amount of cash. Most of these are debt obligations incurred by our Ford Credit segment. In addition, as part of our normal business practices, we enter into contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components, and services to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services. These arrangements, including multi-year offtake commitments, may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase requirements. Purchase obligations in the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table below are defined as off-balance sheet agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms; however, as we purchase raw materials and components beyond the minimum amounts required by the Purchase obligations, our material cash requirements for these items are higher than what is reflected in the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table. For additional information on the timing of these payments and the impact on our working capital, see the Changes in Company Cash section below. \\n 61 \\n\\nItem 7.

See Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for further information regarding our expected 2022 pension contributions and funded status. \\n (f) Purchase obligations under existing offtake agreements for scarce raw materials are not included in the table above. As of December 31, 2022, our forecasted expenditures for the maximum quantity that may be purchased under these offtake agreements, which are subject to satisfaction of the conditions in the agreements, total about 2.4 billion through 2029 based on our present pricing forecast; however, our forecasted prices could fluctuate significantly from period to period, which would result in volatility in the estimate of our overall obligation. In addition, we plan to continue to enter into offtake agreements with raw material suppliers, the costs under which we expect to be significant. \\n \\n We plan to utilize our liquidity (as described above) and our cash flows from business operations to fund our material cash requirements. \\n \\n Changes in Company Cash. In managing our business, we classify changes in Company cash into operating and non-operating items. Operating items include: Company adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit EBT, capital spending, depreciation and tooling amortization, changes in working capital, Ford Credit distributions, interest on debt, cash taxes, and all other and timing differences (including timing differences between accrual-based EBIT and associated cash flows). Non-operating items include: global redesign (including separation payments), changes in Company debt excluding Ford Credit, contributions to funded pension plans, shareholder distributions, and other items (including gains and losses on investments in equity securities, acquisitions and divestitures, equity investments, and other transactions with Ford Credit). \\n\\n62 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n With respect to Changes in working capital, in general we carry relatively low Automotive segment trade receivables compared with our trade payables because the majority of our Automotive wholesales are financed (primarily by Ford Credit) immediately upon the sale of vehicles to dealers, which generally occurs shortly after being produced. In contrast, our Automotive trade payables are based primarily on industry-standard production supplier payment terms of about 45 days. As a result, our cash flow deteriorates if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) decrease while trade payables continue to become due. Conversely, our cash flow improves if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) increase while new trade payables are generally not due for about 45 days. For example, the suspension of production at most of our assembly plants and lower industry volumes due to COVID-19 in early 2020 resulted in an initial deterioration of our cash flow, while the subsequent resumption of manufacturing operations and return to pre-COVID-19 production levels at most of our assembly plants resulted in a subsequent improvement of our cash flow. Even in normal economic conditions, however, these working capital balances generally are subject to seasonal changes that can impact cash flow. For example, we typically experience cash flow timing differences associated with inventories and payables due to our annual summer and December shutdown periods when production, and therefore inventories and wholesale volumes, are usually at their lowest levels, while payables continue to come due and be paid. The net impact of this typically results in cash outflows from changes in our working capital balances during these shutdown periods. \\n \\n Our finished product inventory at December 31, 2022 was higher year over year due to production and release scheduling, which resulted in higher sales inventory, in-transit inventory, and units awaiting upfit. \\n \\n In response to, or in anticipation of, supplier disruptions, we may stockpile certain components or raw materials to help prevent disruption in our production of vehicles. Such actions could have a short-term adverse impact on our cash and increase our inventory. Moreover, in order to secure critical materials for production of electric vehicles, we have entered into and plan to continue to enter into offtake agreements with raw material suppliers and make investments in certain raw material and battery suppliers, including contributing up to 6.6 billion in capital to BlueOval SK, LLC over a five-year period ending in 2026. Such investments, which are part of our plan to invest over 50 billion in electric vehicles through 2026, could have an additional adverse impact on our cash in the near-term. \\n \\n The terms of the offtake agreements we have entered into, and those we may enter into in the future, vary by transaction, though they generally obligate us to purchase a certain percentage or minimum amount of output produced by the counterparty over an agreed upon period of time. The purchase price mechanism included in the offtake agreement is typically based on the market price of the material at the time of delivery. The terms also may include conditions to our obligation to purchase the materials, such as quality or minimum output. Subject to satisfaction of those conditions, we will be obligated to purchase the materials at the cost determined by the purchase price mechanism. Based on the offtake agreements we have entered into thus far, the earliest date by which we could be obligated to purchase any output, subject to satisfaction of the applicable conditions, will be in 2024. \\n \\n Financial institutions participate in a supply chain finance SCF program that enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their Ford receivables (i.e., our payment obligations to the suppliers) to the financial institutions on a non-recourse basis in order to be paid earlier than our payment terms provide. Our suppliers voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms, the amounts we pay, or our liquidity. We have no economic interest in a supplier s decision to participate in the SCF program, and we have no direct financial relationship with the SCF financial institutions. Moreover, we do not provide any guarantees in connection with the SCF program. As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding amount of Ford receivables that suppliers elected to sell to the SCF financial institutions was 253 million. The amount settled through the SCF program during 2022 was 1.4 billion. \\n \\n 63 \\n\\nItem 7.

The year-over-year decrease was driven by a decrease in Ford Credit operating cash flow partially offset by favorable timing differences. Company adjusted free cash flow was 9.1 billion, 4.5 billion higher than a year ago, driven by higher Company adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit, timing benefits, improvement in working capital, and lower interest expense, offset partially by lower Ford Credit distributions. \\n \\n Capital spending was 6.5 billion in 2022, 0.3 billion higher than a year ago, and is expected to be in the range of 8 billion to 9 billion in 2023. \\n \\n The full year 2022 working capital impact was 0.2 billion positive, driven by higher payables. All other and timing differences were positive 1.9 billion. Timing differences include differences between accrual-based EBIT and the associated cash flows (e.g., pension and OPEB income or expense; compensation payments; marketing incentive and warranty payments to dealers). \\n \\n Shareholder distributions (including dividends and anti-dilutive share repurchases) were 2.5 billion in 2022. On February 2, 2023, we declared a regular dividend of 0.15 per share and a supplemental dividend of 0.65 per share. \\n \\n We previously announced our plan for the global redesign of our business, pursuant to which we are working to turn around automotive operations, compete like a challenger, and capitalize on our strengths by allocating more capital, more resources, and more talent to our strongest businesses and vehicle franchises. The cash effect related to our global redesign activities was 3.9 billion through December 31, 2022. \\n \\n 64 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Available Credit Lines . Total Company committed credit lines, excluding Ford Credit, at December 31, 2022 were 19.3 billion, consisting of 13.5 billion of our corporate credit facility, 2.0 billion of our supplemental revolving credit facility, 1.75 billion of our 364-day revolving credit facility, and 2.1 billion of local credit facilities. At December 31, 2022, the utilized portion of the corporate credit facility was 19 million, representing amounts utilized for letters of credit, and the full 1.75 billion of our 364-day revolving credit facility was utilized by Ford Credit, in its capacity as a subsidiary borrower under that facility. In addition, 1.7 billion of committed Company credit lines, excluding Ford Credit, was utilized under local credit facilities for our affiliates as of December 31, 2022. As of January 25, 2023, Ford Credit had repaid the full 1.75 billion outstanding under the 364-day revolving credit facility. \\n \\n Lenders under our corporate credit facility have 3.4 billion of commitments maturing on June 23, 2025 and 10.1 billion of commitments maturing on June 23, 2027. Lenders under our supplemental revolving credit facility have 0.1 billion of commitments maturing on September 29, 2024 and 1.9 billion of commitments maturing on June 23, 2025. Lenders under our 364-day revolving credit facility have 1.75 billion of commitments maturing on June 22, 2023. \\n \\n The corporate, supplemental, and 364-day credit agreements include certain sustainability-linked targets, pursuant to which the applicable margin and facility fees may be adjusted if Ford achieves, or fails to achieve, the specified targets related to global manufacturing facility greenhouse gas emissions, renewable electricity consumption, and Ford Europe CO 2 tailpipe emissions. Ford outperformed the 2021 targets for all three of the sustainability-linked metrics, which impacted pricing beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022. \\n \\n The corporate credit facility is unsecured and free of material adverse change conditions to borrowing, restrictive financial covenants (for example, interest or fixed-charge coverage ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and minimum net worth requirements), and credit rating triggers that could limit our ability to obtain funding or trigger early repayment. The corporate credit facility contains a liquidity covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum of 4 billion in aggregate of domestic cash, cash equivalents, and loaned and marketable securities and/or availability under the corporate credit facility, supplemental revolving credit facility, and 364-day revolving credit facility. The terms and conditions of the supplemental and 364-day revolving credit facilities are consistent with our corporate credit facility. Ford Credit has been designated as a subsidiary borrower under the corporate credit facility and the 364-day revolving credit facility. \\n \\n Each of the corporate credit facility, supplemental revolving credit facility, and 364-day revolving credit facility include a covenant that requires us to provide guarantees from certain of our subsidiaries in the event that our senior, unsecured, long-term debt does not maintain at least two investment grade ratings from Fitch, Moody s, and S P. The following subsidiaries have provided unsecured guarantees to the lenders under the credit facilities: Ford Component Sales, LLC; Ford European Holdings Inc.; Ford Global Technologies, LLC; Ford Holdings LLC (the parent company of Ford Credit); Ford International Capital LLC; Ford Mexico Holdings LLC; Ford Motor Service Company; Ford Next LLC; and Ford Trading Company, LLC. \\n \\n Debt. As shown in Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, at December 31, 2022, Company debt excluding Ford Credit was 19.9 billion. This balance is 400 million lower than at December 31, 2021, primarily reflecting the repayment in full of our 1.5 billion delayed draw term loan facility, repayment of the remaining 953 million under our Loan Arrangement and Reimbursement Agreement with the U.S. Department of Energy, a 1.1 billion redemption of higher coupon debt, and scheduled maturities, partially offset by the 750 million 903 million as of December 31, 2022) draw on our U.K. Export Finance term loan credit facility and the issuance of our 1.8 billion green bond and 600 million retail bond. \\n \\n Leverage. We manage Company debt (excluding Ford Credit) levels with a leverage framework that targets investment grade credit ratings through a normal business cycle. The leverage framework includes a ratio of total Company debt (excluding Ford Credit), underfunded pension liabilities, operating leases, and other adjustments, divided by Company adjusted EBIT (excluding Ford Credit EBT), and further adjusted to exclude depreciation and tooling amortization (excluding Ford Credit). \\n \\n Ford Credit s leverage is calculated as a separate business as described in the Liquidity - Ford Credit Segment section of Item 7. Ford Credit is self-funding and its debt, which is used to fund its operations, is separate from our Company debt excluding Ford Credit. \\n \\n 65 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Ford Credit Segment \\n \\n Ford Credit ended 2022 with 21 billion of liquidity. During the year, Ford Credit completed 16 billion of public term funding. \\n \\n Key elements of Ford Credit s funding strategy include: \\n \\n Maintain strong liquidity and funding diversity \\n Prudently access public markets \\n Continue growth of retail deposits in Europe \\n Flexibility to increase ABS mix as needed; preserving assets and committed capacity \\n Target financial statement leverage of 9:1 to 10:1 \\n Maintain self-liquidating balance sheet \\n \\n Ford Credit s liquidity profile continues to be diverse, robust, and focused on maintaining liquidity levels that meet its business and funding requirements. Ford Credit regularly stress tests its balance sheet and liquidity to ensure that it can continue to meet its financial obligations through economic cycles. \\n \\n Funding Sources. Ford Credit s funding sources include primarily unsecured debt and securitization transactions (including other structured financings). Ford Credit issues both short-term and long-term debt that is held by both institutional and retail investors, with long-term debt having an original maturity of more than 12 months. Ford Credit sponsors a number of securitization programs that can be structured to provide both short-term and long-term funding through institutional investors and other financial institutions in the United States and international capital markets. \\n \\n Ford Credit obtains unsecured funding from the sale of demand notes under its Ford Interest Advantage program and through the retail deposit programs at FCE Bank plc FCE and Ford Bank GmbH Ford Bank ). At December 31, 2022, the principal amount outstanding of Ford Interest Advantage notes, which may be redeemed at any time at the option of the holders thereof without restriction, and FCE and Ford Bank deposits was 14.3 billion. Ford Credit maintains multiple sources of readily available liquidity to fund the payment of its unsecured short-term debt obligations. \\n \\n The following table shows funding for Ford Credit s net receivables (in billions): December 31, 2020 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2022 Funding Structure Term unsecured debt 73.3 59.4 48.3 Term asset-backed securities 54.6 45.4 56.4 Ford Interest Advantage / Retail Deposits 9.8 12.9 14.3 Other (3.1) (0.2) 2.6 Equity 15.6 12.4 11.9 Adjustments for cash (18.5) (12.4) (11.2) Total Net Receivables 131.7 117.5 122.3 Securitized Funding as Percent of Total Debt 39.6 38.5 47.4 \\n \\n Net receivables of 122.3 billion at December 31, 2022 were funded primarily with term debt and term asset-backed securities. Securitized funding as a percent of total debt was 47.4 . \\n\\n66 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Public Term Funding Plan. The following table shows Ford Credit s issuances for full year 2020, 2021, and 2022, and planned issuances for full year 2023, excluding short-term funding programs (in billions): \\n 2020 Actual 2021 Actual 2022 Actual 2023 Forecast Unsecured 14 5 6 10 - 13 Securitizations 13 9 10 10 - 13 Total public 27 14 16 20 - 26 \\n \\n In 2022, Ford Credit completed 16 billion of public term funding. For 2023, Ford Credit projects full year public term funding in the range of 20 billion to 26 billion. Through February 1, 2023, Ford Credit has completed 5 billion of public term issuances. \\n \\n Liquidity. The following table shows Ford Credit s liquidity sources and utilization (in billions): \\n December 31, 2020 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2022 Liquidity Sources (a) \\n Cash 18.5 12.4 11.2 Committed asset-backed facilities 38.1 37.1 37.4 Other unsecured credit facilities 2.5 2.7 2.3 Total liquidity sources 59.1 52.2 50.9 Utilization of Liquidity (a) \\n Securitization cash and restricted cash (3.9) (3.9) (2.9) Committed asset-backed facilities (16.7) (12.5) (26.6) Other unsecured credit facilities (0.5) (1.0) (0.8) Total utilization of liquidity (21.1) (17.4) (30.3) Gross liquidity 38.0 34.8 20.6 Asset-backed capacity in excess of eligible receivables and other adjustments (2.6) (2.8) 0.4 Net liquidity available for use 35.4 32.0 21.0 \\n __________ \\n (a) See Definitions and Information Regarding Ford Credit Causal Factors section. \\n \\n Ford Credit s net liquidity available for use will fluctuate quarterly based on factors including near-term debt maturities, receivable growth and decline, and timing of funding transactions. At December 31, 2022, Ford Credit s net liquidity available for use was 21 billion, 11 billion lower than year-end 2021. Ford Credit s net liquidity remains robust and aligns with lower near-term refinancing obligations. Ford Credit s sources of liquidity include cash, committed asset-backed facilities, and unsecured credit facilities. At December 31, 2022, Ford Credit s liquidity sources totaled 50.9 billion, down 1.3 billion from year-end 2021. Ford Credit continues to be well capitalized with a strong balance sheet. \\n \\n Material Cash Requirements. Ford Credit s material cash requirements include: (1) the purchase of retail financing and operating lease contracts from dealers and providing wholesale financing for dealers to finance new and used vehicles; and (2) debt repayments (for additional information on debt, see the Balance Sheet Liquidity Profile section below, the Material Cash Requirements section in Liquidity and Capital Resources - Company excluding Ford Credit above, and Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements). In addition, subject to approval by Ford Credit s Board of Directors, shareholder distributions may require the expenditure of a material amount of cash. Moreover, Ford Credit may be subject to additional material cash requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, e.g., legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions, and other matters. \\n \\n Ford Credit plans to utilize its liquidity (as described above) and its cash flows from business operations to fund its material cash requirements. \\n \\n 67 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Balance Sheet Liquidity Profile. Ford Credit defines its balance sheet liquidity profile as the cumulative maturities, including the impact of expected prepayments and allowance for credit losses, of its finance receivables, investment in operating leases, and cash, less the cumulative debt maturities over upcoming annual periods. Ford Credit s balance sheet is inherently liquid because of the short-term nature of its finance receivables, investment in operating leases, and cash. Ford Credit ensures its cumulative debt maturities have a longer tenor than its cumulative asset maturities. This positive maturity profile is intended to provide Ford Credit with additional liquidity after all of its assets have been funded and is in addition to liquidity available to protect for stress scenarios. \\n \\n The following table shows Ford Credit s cumulative maturities for assets and total debt for the periods presented and unsecured long-term debt maturities in the individual periods presented (in billions): \\n 2023 2024 2025 2026 and Beyond Balance Sheet Liquidity Profile Assets (a) 71 97 117 137 Total debt (b) 58 83 100 121 Memo: Unsecured long-term debt maturities 8 12 11 17 \\n __________ \\n (a) Includes gross finance receivables less the allowance for credit losses (including certain finance receivables that are reclassified in consolidation to Trade and other receivables ), investment in operating leases net of accumulated depreciation, cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding amounts related to insurance activities). Amounts shown include the impact of expected prepayments. \\n (b) Excludes unamortized debt (discount)/premium, unamortized issuance costs, and fair value adjustments. \\n \\n Maturities of investment in operating leases consist primarily of the portion of rental payments attributable to depreciation over the remaining life of the lease and the expected residual value at lease termination. Maturities of finance receivables and investment in operating leases in the table above include expected prepayments for Ford Credit s retail installment sale contracts and investment in operating leases. The table above also reflects adjustments to debt maturities to match the asset-backed debt maturities with the underlying asset maturities. \\n \\n All wholesale securitization transactions and wholesale receivables are shown maturing in the next 12 months, even if the maturities extend beyond 2023. The retail securitization transactions under certain committed asset-backed facilities are assumed to amortize immediately rather than amortizing after the expiration of the commitment period. As of December 31, 2022, Ford Credit had 137 billion of assets, 60 billion of which were unencumbered. \\n \\n Funding and Liquidity Risks. Ford Credit s funding plan is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control, including disruption in the capital markets that could impact both unsecured debt and asset-backed securities and the effects of regulatory changes on the financial markets. \\n \\n Despite Ford Credit s diverse sources of funding and liquidity, its ability to maintain liquidity may be affected by, among others, the following factors (not necessarily listed in order of importance or probability of occurrence): \\n \\n Prolonged disruption of the debt and securitization markets; \\n Global capital market volatility; \\n Credit ratings assigned to Ford and Ford Credit; \\n Market capacity for Ford- and Ford Credit-sponsored investments; \\n General demand for the type of securities Ford Credit offers; \\n Ford Credit s ability to continue funding through asset-backed financing structures; \\n Performance of the underlying assets within Ford Credit s asset-backed financing structures; \\n Inability to obtain hedging instruments; \\n Accounting and regulatory changes; and \\n Ford Credit s ability to maintain credit facilities and committed asset-backed facilities. \\n \\n Stress Tests. Ford Credit regularly conducts stress testing on its funding and liquidity sources to ensure it can continue to meet financial obligations and support the sale of Ford and Lincoln vehicles during firm-specific and market-wide stress events. Stress tests are intended to quantify the potential impact of various adverse scenarios on the balance sheet and liquidity. These scenarios include assumptions on access to unsecured and secured debt markets, runoff of short-term funding, and ability to renew expiring liquidity commitments and are measured over various time periods, including 30 days, 90 days, and longer term. Ford Credit s stress test does not assume any additional funding, liquidity, or capital support from Ford. Ford Credit routinely develops contingency funding plans as part of its liquidity stress testing. \\n 68 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Leverage. Ford Credit uses leverage, or the debt-to-equity ratio, to make various business decisions, including evaluating and establishing pricing for finance receivable and operating lease financing, and assessing its capital structure. \\n \\n The table below shows the calculation of Ford Credit s financial statement leverage (in billions): December 31, 2020 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2022 Leverage Calculation Debt 137.7 117.7 119.0 Equity (a) 15.6 12.4 11.9 Financial statement leverage (to 1) 8.8 9.5 10.0 \\n __________ \\n (a) Total shareholder s interest reported on Ford Credit s balance sheets. \\n \\n Ford Credit plans its leverage by considering market conditions and the risk characteristics of its business. At December 31, 2022, Ford Credit s financial statement leverage was 10:1. Ford Credit targets financial statement leverage in the range of 9:1 to 10:1. \\n 69 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Total Company \\n \\n Pension Plan Contributions and Strategy. Our strategy is to reduce the risk of our funded defined benefit pension plans, including minimizing the volatility of the value of our pension assets relative to pension liabilities and the need for unplanned use of capital resources to fund the plans. The strategy reduces balance sheet, cash flow, and income exposures and, in turn, reduces our risk profile. Going forward, we expect to: \\n \\n Limit our pension contributions to offset ongoing service cost or meet regulatory requirements, if any; \\n Minimize the volatility of the value of our pension assets relative to pension obligations and ensure assets are sufficient to pay plan benefits; and \\n Evaluate strategic actions to reduce pension liabilities, such as plan design changes, curtailments, or settlements \\n 2021 2022 2022 H / (L) 2021 Pension Funded Status B) \\n U.S. Plans 1.0 0.1 (0.9) Non-U.S. Plans (1.3) (0.3) 1.0 Total Global Pension (0.3) (0.2) 0.1 Year-End Discount Rate (Weighted Average) \\n U.S. Plans 2.91 5.51 2.60 ppts Non-U.S. Plans 1.75 4.42 2.67 ppts Actual Asset Returns U.S. Plans 2.82 (21.20) (24.02) ppts Non-U.S. Plans 2.69 (25.40) (28.09) ppts Pension - Funded Plans Only B) \\n Funded Status 5.8 4.1 (1.7) Contributions for Funded Plans 0.8 0.6 (0.2) \\n \\n Worldwide, our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by 0.2 billion at December 31, 2022, an improvement of 0.1 billion from December 31, 2021, primarily reflecting the impact of higher discount rates mostly offset by negative asset performance. Of the 0.2 billion underfunded status at year-end 2022, our funded plans were 4.1 billion overfunded and our unfunded plans were 4.3 billion underfunded. These unfunded plans are pay as you go with benefits paid from Company cash and primarily include certain plans in Germany and U.S. defined benefit plans for senior management. \\n \\n The fixed income mix was 79 in both our U.S. plans and non-U.S. plans at year-end 2022. \\n \\n In 2022, we contributed 567 million to our global funded pension plans, a decrease of 206 million compared with 2021. During 2023, we expect to contribute between 500 million and 600 million of cash to our global funded pension plans. We also expect to make about 400 million of benefit payments to participants in unfunded plans. Based on current assumptions and regulations, we do not expect to have a legal requirement to fund our major U.S. plans in 2023. Our global funded plans remain fully funded in aggregate, demonstrating the effectiveness of our de-risking strategy and our commitment to a strong balance sheet. \\n \\n For a detailed discussion of our pension plans, refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates - Pensions and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2022 Form 10-K Report and Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. \\n 70 \\n\\nItem 7.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n CREDIT RATINGS \\n \\n Our short-term and long-term debt is rated by four credit rating agencies designated as nationally recognized statistical rating organizations NRSROs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission: DBRS, Fitch, Moody s, and S P. \\n \\n In several markets, locally recognized rating agencies also rate us. A credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the credit risk associated with a corporate entity or particular securities issued by that entity. Rating agencies ratings of us are based on information provided by us and other sources. Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria for evaluating company risk and, therefore, ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. \\n \\n There have been no rating actions taken by these NRSROs since the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. \\n \\n The following table summarizes certain of the credit ratings and outlook presently assigned by these four NRSROs: NRSRO RATINGS Ford Ford Credit NRSROs Issuer Default / Corporate / Issuer Rating Long-Term Senior Unsecured Outlook / Trend Long-Term Senior Unsecured Short-Term Unsecured Outlook / Trend Minimum Long-Term Investment Grade Rating DBRS BB (high) BB (high) Positive BB (high) R-4 Positive BBB (low) Fitch BB+ BB+ Positive BB+ B Positive BBB- Moody s N/A Ba2 Stable Ba2 NP Stable Baa3 S P BB+ BB+ Positive BB+ B Positive BBB- \\n \\n 72 \\n\\nItem 7.

We also expect adjusted free cash flow of about 6 billion, which assumes no distributions from Ford Credit. \\n \\n Our outlook for 2023 assumes the headwinds and tailwinds below. \\n \\n Headwinds: \\n An expected mild U.S. recession and a moderate recession in Europe \\n Higher incentives across the industry as supply and demand come back into balance \\n Ford Credit EBT of about 1.3 billion, down about 1.4 billion, reflecting unfavorable lease residuals and credit losses and the non-recurrence of derivative gains \\n Continuation of the strong dollar \\n About 2 billion lower past service pension income \\n Continued investments in growth, including in customer experience, connected services, and capital expenditures \\n \\n Tailwinds: \\n Improvement in the supply chain and industry volume \\n Launch of our all-new Super Duty \\n Lower cost of goods sold, including efficiencies in materials, commodities, logistics, and other parts of our industrial platform \\n \\n Additionally, we will be negotiating a new contract with the UAW in the United States. \\n \\n 73 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements \\n \\n Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations, forecasts, and assumptions by our management and involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: \\n \\n Ford and Ford Credit s financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by public health issues, including epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19; \\n Ford is highly dependent on its suppliers to deliver components in accordance with Ford s production schedule and specifications, and a shortage of or inability to acquire key components, such as semiconductors, or raw materials, such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, can disrupt Ford s production of vehicles; \\n To facilitate access to the raw materials necessary for the production of electric vehicles, Ford has entered into, and expects to continue to enter into, multi-year commitments to raw material suppliers that subject Ford to risks associated with lower future demand for such materials as well as costs that fluctuate and are difficult to accurately forecast; \\n Ford s long-term competitiveness depends on the successful execution of Ford+; \\n Ford s vehicles could be affected by defects that result in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, or increased warranty costs; \\n Ford may not realize the anticipated benefits of existing or pending strategic alliances, joint ventures, acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings, or new business strategies; \\n Operational systems, security systems, vehicles, and services could be affected by cyber incidents, ransomware attacks, and other disruptions and impact Ford and Ford Credit as well as their suppliers and dealers; \\n Ford s production, as well as Ford s suppliers production, and/or the ability to deliver products to consumers could be disrupted by labor issues, natural or man-made disasters, adverse effects of climate change, financial distress, production difficulties, capacity limitations, or other factors; \\n Ford s ability to maintain a competitive cost structure could be affected by labor or other constraints; \\n Ford s ability to attract and retain talented, diverse, and highly skilled employees is critical to its success and competitiveness; \\n Ford s new and existing products and digital, software, and physical services are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries and its reputation may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced; \\n Ford s results are dependent on sales of larger, more profitable vehicles, particularly in the United States; \\n With a global footprint, Ford s results could be adversely affected by economic or geopolitical developments, including protectionist trade policies such as tariffs, or other events; \\n Industry sales volume can be volatile and could decline if there is a financial crisis, recession, or significant geopolitical event; \\n Ford may face increased price competition or a reduction in demand for its products resulting from industry excess capacity, currency fluctuations, competitive actions, or other factors; \\n Inflationary pressure and fluctuations in commodity and energy prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and market value of Ford or Ford Credit s investments, including marketable securities, can have a significant effect on results; \\n Ford and Ford Credit s access to debt, securitization, or derivative markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts could be affected by credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, regulatory requirements, or other factors; \\n The impact of government incentives on Ford s business could be significant, and Ford s receipt of government incentives could be subject to reduction, termination, or clawback; \\n Ford Credit could experience higher-than-expected credit losses, lower-than-anticipated residual values, or higher-than-expected return volumes for leased vehicles; \\n Economic and demographic experience for pension and OPEB plans (e.g., discount rates or investment returns) could be worse than Ford has assumed; \\n Pension and other postretirement liabilities could adversely affect Ford s liquidity and financial condition; \\n Ford and Ford Credit could experience unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations, or adverse publicity arising out of alleged defects in products, services, perceived environmental impacts, or otherwise; \\n Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations; \\n Ford and Ford Credit could be affected by the continued development of more stringent privacy, data use, and data protection laws and regulations as well as consumers heightened expectations to safeguard their personal information; and \\n Ford Credit could be subject to new or increased credit regulations, consumer protection regulations, or other regulations. \\n \\n 74 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n We cannot be certain that any expectation, forecast, or assumption made in preparing forward-looking statements will prove accurate, or that any projection will be realized. It is to be expected that there may be differences between projected and actual results. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of their initial issuance, and we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. For additional discussion, see Item 1A. Risk Factors above. \\n 75 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT SUPPLEMENT GAAP MEASURES \\n \\n We use both generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for operational and financial decision making, and to assess Company and segment business performance. The non-GAAP measures listed below are intended to be considered by users as supplemental information to their equivalent GAAP measures, to aid investors in better understanding our financial results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful perspective on underlying operating results and trends, and a means to compare our period-over-period results. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in items or events being adjusted. \\n \\n Company Adjusted EBIT (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Income/(Loss) Attributable to Ford) Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) excludes interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), taxes, and pre-tax special items. This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it focuses on underlying operating results and trends, and improves comparability of our period-over-period results. Our management ordinarily excludes special items from its review of the results of the operating segments for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources. Our categories of pre-tax special items and the applicable significance guideline for each item (which may consist of a group of items related to a single event or action) are as follows: \\n \\n Pre-Tax Special Item Significance Guideline Pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses No minimum Gains and losses on investments in equity securities No minimum Personnel expenses, dealer-related costs, and facility-related charges stemming from our efforts to match production capacity and cost structure to market demand and changing model mix \\n Generally 100 million or more Other items that we do not necessarily consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities 500 million or more for individual field service actions; generally 100 million or more for other items \\n \\n When we provide guidance for adjusted EBIT, we do not provide guidance on a net income basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty, including gains and losses on pension and OPEB remeasurements and on investments in equity securities. \\n \\n Company Adjusted EBIT Margin (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Company Net Income/(Loss) Margin) Company Adjusted EBIT margin is Company adjusted EBIT divided by Company revenue. This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it allows users to evaluate our operating results aligned with industry reporting. \\n \\n Adjusted Earnings/(Loss) Per Share (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Earnings/(Loss) Per Share) Measure of Company s diluted net earnings/(loss) per share adjusted for impact of pre-tax special items (described above), tax special items, and restructuring impacts in noncontrolling interests. The measure provides investors with useful information to evaluate performance of our business excluding items not indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities. When we provide guidance for adjusted earnings/(loss) per share, we do not provide guidance on an earnings/(loss) per share basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses. \\n \\n Adjusted Effective Tax Rate (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Effective Tax Rate) Measure of Company s tax rate excluding pre-tax special items (described above) and tax special items. The measure provides an ongoing effective rate which investors find useful for historical comparisons and for forecasting. When we provide guidance for adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide guidance on an effective tax rate basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses. \\n 76 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Company Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Cash Provided By/(Used In) Operating Activities) Measure of Company s operating cash flow excluding Ford Credit s operating cash flows. The measure contains elements management considers operating activities, including Company excluding Ford Credit capital spending, Ford Credit distributions to its parent, and settlement of derivatives. The measure excludes cash outflows for funded pension contributions, global redesign (including separations), and other items that are considered operating cash flows under U.S. GAAP. This measure is useful to management and investors because it is consistent with management s assessment of the Company s operating cash flow performance. When we provide guidance for Company adjusted free cash flow, we do not provide guidance for net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities because the GAAP measure will include items that are difficult to quantify or predict with reasonable certainty, including cash flows related to the Company's exposures to foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices (separate from any related hedges), Ford Credit's operating cash flows, and cash flows related to special items, including separation payments, each of which individually or in the aggregate could have a significant impact to our net cash provided by/(used in) our operating activities. \\n \\n Adjusted ROIC Calculated as the sum of adjusted net operating profit/(loss) after cash tax from the last four quarters, divided by the average invested capital over the last four quarters. Adjusted Return on Invested Capital Adjusted ROIC provides management and investors with useful information to evaluate the Company s after-cash tax operating return on its invested capital for the period presented. Adjusted net operating profit/(loss) after cash tax measures operating results less special items, interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), and certain pension/OPEB costs. Average invested capital is the sum of average balance sheet equity, debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), and net pension/OPEB liability. \\n 77 \\n\\nItem 7.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \\n\\nWe consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. \\n \\n Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. \\n \\n Warranties and Field Service Actions \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required. We provide base warranties on the products we sell for specific periods of time and/or mileage, which vary depending upon the type of product and the geographic location of its sale. Separately, we also periodically perform field service actions related to safety recalls, emission recalls, and other product campaigns. Pursuant to these warranties and field service actions, we will repair, replace, or adjust parts on a vehicle that are defective in factory-supplied materials or workmanship. We accrue the estimated cost of both base warranty coverages and field service actions at the time of sale. In addition, from time to time, we issue extended warranties at our expense, the estimated cost of which is accrued at the time of issuance. \\n \\n Assumptions and Approach Used. We establish our estimate of base warranty obligations using a patterned estimation model. We use historical information regarding the nature, frequency, and average cost of claims for each vehicle line by model year. We reevaluate our estimate of base warranty obligations on a regular basis. Experience has shown that initial data for any given model year may be volatile; therefore, our process relies on long-term historical averages until sufficient data are available. With actual experience, we use the data to update the historical averages. We then compare the resulting accruals with present spending rates to assess whether the balances are adequate to meet expected future obligations. Based on this data, we update our estimates as necessary. \\n \\n Field service actions may occur in periods beyond the base warranty coverage period. We establish our estimates of field service action obligations using a patterned estimation model. We use historical information regarding the nature, frequency, severity, and average cost of claims for each model year. We assess our obligation for field service actions on a regular basis using actual claims experience and update our estimates as necessary. \\n \\n Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors used in establishing our estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 25 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for information regarding warranty and field service action costs. \\n \\n Pensions and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required. The estimation of our defined benefit pension and OPEB plan obligations and expenses requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events, such as demographic experience and health care cost increases. Plan obligations and expenses are based on existing retirement plan provisions. No assumption is made regarding any potential future changes to benefit provisions beyond those to which we are presently committed (e.g., in existing labor contracts). \\n 84 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Assumptions and Approach Used. The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: \\n \\n Discount rates. Our discount rate assumptions are based primarily on the results of cash flow matching analyses, which match the future cash outflows for each major plan to a yield curve based on high-quality bonds specific to the country of the plan. Benefit payments are discounted at the rates on the curve to determine the year-end obligations. \\n \\n Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Our expected long-term rate of return considers inputs from a range of advisors for capital market returns, inflation, bond yields, and other variables, adjusted for specific aspects of our investment strategy by plan. Historical returns also are considered when appropriate. The assumption is based on consideration of all inputs, with a focus on long-term trends to avoid short-term market influences. \\n \\n Salary growth. Our salary growth assumption reflects our actual experience, long-term outlook, and assumed inflation. \\n \\n Inflation. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators, including real gross domestic product growth and central bank inflation targets. \\n \\n Expected contributions. Our expected amount and timing of contributions are based on an assessment of minimum requirements, cash availability, and other considerations (e.g., funded status, avoidance of regulatory premiums and levies, and tax efficiency). \\n \\n Retirement rates. Retirement rates are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience. \\n \\n Mortality rates. Mortality rates are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience. \\n \\n Health care cost trends . Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook, and an assessment of likely long-term trends. \\n \\n Assumptions are set at each year-end and are generally not changed during the year unless there is a major plan event, such as a curtailment or settlement that would trigger a plan remeasurement. \\n \\n See Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding pension and OPEB costs and assumptions. \\n \\n Pension Plans \\n \\n Effect of Actual Results . The year-end 2022 weighted average discount rate was 5.51 for U.S. plans and 4.42 for non-U.S. plans, reflecting increases of 260 and 267 basis points, respectively, compared with year-end 2021. In 2022, the U.S. actual return on assets was negative 21.20 , which was lower than the expected long-term rate of return of 5.75 . Non-U.S. actual return on assets was negative 25.40 , which was lower than the expected long-term rate of return of 3.29 . The lower returns are explained by losses on fixed income and growth assets, both of which were consistent with broader market performance. In total, higher rates and pension asset losses, in addition to demographic and other updates, resulted in a net remeasurement loss of 1.3 billion, which has been recognized within net periodic benefit cost and reported as a special item. \\n \\n For 2023, the expected long-term rate of return on assets is 6.25 for U.S. plans, up 50 basis points from 2022, and 4.13 for non-U.S. plans, up 84 basis points compared with a year ago, reflecting higher nominal risk-free rates and a higher consensus on capital market return expectations from advisors. \\n \\n De-risking Strategy . We employ a broad de-risking strategy for our global funded plans that increases the matching characteristics of our assets relative to our obligation as funded status improves. Changes in interest rates, which directly influence changes in discount rates, in addition to other factors have a significant impact on the value of our pension obligation and fixed income asset portfolio. Our de-risking strategy has increased the allocation to fixed income investments and reduced our funded status sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates should result in offsetting effects in the value of our pension obligation and the value of the fixed income asset portfolio. \\n 85 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Sensitivity Analysis. The December 31, 2022 pension funded status and 2023 expense are affected by year-end 2022 assumptions. Sensitivities to these assumptions may be asymmetric and are specific to the time periods noted. The effects of changes in the factors that generally have the largest impact on year-end funded status and pension expense are discussed below. \\n \\n Discount rates and interest rates have the largest impact on our obligations and fixed income assets. The table below estimates the effect on our funded status of an increase/decrease in discount rates and interest rates (in millions): Basis Point Change Increase/(Decrease) in December 31, 2022 Funded Status Factor U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans Discount rate - obligation +/- 100 bps 2,700/ (3,200) 2,500/ (3,100) Interest rate - fixed income assets +/- 100 (2,600)/3,100 (1,700)/2,000 Net impact on funded status 100/ (100) 800/ (1,100) \\n \\n The fixed income asset sensitivity shown excludes other fixed income return components (e.g., changes in credit spreads, bond coupon and active management excess returns), and growth asset returns. Other factors that affect net funded status (e.g., contributions) are not reflected. \\n \\n Interest rates and the expected long-term rate of return on assets have the largest effect on pension expense. These assumptions are generally set at each year-end for expense recorded throughout the following year. The table below estimates the effect on pension expense of a higher/lower assumption for these factors (in millions): Basis Point Change Increase/(Decrease) in 2023 Pension Expense Factor U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans Interest rate - service cost and interest cost +/- 25 bps 25/ (25) 10/ (10) Expected long-term rate of return on assets +/- 25 (80)/80 (50)/50 \\n \\n The effect of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities. The sensitivity of pension expense to a change in discount rate assumptions may not be linear. \\n \\n Other Postretirement Employee Benefits \\n \\n Effect of Actual Results . The weighted average discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation for worldwide OPEB plans at December 31, 2022 was 5.48 , compared with 2.97 at December 31, 2021, resulting in a worldwide net remeasurement gain of 1.3 billion, which has been recognized within net periodic benefit cost and reported as a special item. \\n \\n Sensitivity Analysis. Discount rates and interest rates have the largest effect on our OPEB obligation and expense. The table below estimates the effect on 2023 OPEB expense of higher/lower assumptions for these factors (in millions): Worldwide OPEB Basis Point Change (Increase)/Decrease 2022 YE Obligation Increase/(Decrease) 2023 Expense Factor Discount rate - obligation +/- 100 bps 415/ (495) N/A Interest rate - service cost and interest cost +/- 25 N/A 5/ (5) \\n \\n Income Taxes \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required. We must make estimates and apply judgment in determining the provision for income taxes for financial reporting purposes. We make these estimates and judgments primarily in the following areas: (i) the calculation of tax credits, (ii) the calculation of differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax reporting and financial statement purposes, as well as (iii) the calculation of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Changes in these estimates and judgments may result in a material increase or decrease to our tax provision, which would be recorded in the period in which the change occurs. \\n 86 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Assumptions and Approach Used. We are subject to the income tax laws and regulations of the many jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws and regulations are complex and involve uncertainties in the application to our facts and circumstances that may be open to interpretation. We recognize benefits for these uncertain tax positions based upon a process that requires judgment regarding the technical application of the laws, regulations, and various related judicial opinions. If, in our judgment, it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50 that the uncertain tax position will be settled favorably for us, we estimate an amount that ultimately will be realized. This process is inherently subjective since it requires our assessment of the probability of future outcomes. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis, including consideration of changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial opinions, as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. Changes to our estimate of the amount to be realized are recorded in our provision for income taxes during the period in which the change occurred. \\n \\n We must also assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income and reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized. \\n \\n This assessment, which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis, takes into account various types of evidence, including the following: \\n \\n Nature, frequency, and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses. A pattern of objectively measured recent financial reporting losses is heavily weighted as a source of negative evidence. We generally consider cumulative pre-tax losses in the three-year period ending with the current quarter to be significant negative evidence regarding future profitability. We also consider the strength and trend of earnings, as well as other relevant factors. In certain circumstances, historical information may not be as relevant due to changes in our business operations; \\n \\n Sources of future taxable income. Future reversals of existing temporary differences are heavily weighted sources of objectively verifiable positive evidence. Projections of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences are a source of positive evidence only when the projections are combined with a history of recent profits and can be reasonably estimated. Otherwise, these projections are considered inherently subjective and generally will not be sufficient to overcome negative evidence that includes relevant cumulative losses in recent years, particularly if the projected future taxable income is dependent on an anticipated turnaround to profitability that has not yet been achieved. In such cases, we generally give these projections of future taxable income no weight for the purposes of our valuation allowance assessment; and \\n \\n Tax planning strategies. If necessary and available, tax planning strategies could be implemented to accelerate taxable amounts to utilize expiring carryforwards. These strategies would be a source of additional positive evidence and, depending on their nature, could be heavily weighted. \\n \\n In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider the trade-offs between cash preservation and cash outlays to preserve tax credits. During 2022, we reversed 405 million of U.S. valuation allowances primarily as a result of planning actions. We presently believe that global valuation allowances of 822 million are required and that we ultimately will recover the remaining 14 billion of deferred tax assets. However, the ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets is subject to a number of variables, including our future profitability within relevant tax jurisdictions, and future tax planning and the related effects on our cash and liquidity position. Accordingly, our valuation allowances may increase or decrease in future periods. \\n \\n For additional information regarding income taxes, see Note 7 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. \\n 87 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Impairment of Long-Lived Assets \\n \\n Asset groups are tested at the level of the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Our asset groups presently are the regional Automotive business units (i.e., North America, South America, Europe, China (including Taiwan), and the International Markets Group), Ford Credit, and the separate legal entities within the Mobility segment. Asset groupings for impairment analysis are reevaluated when events occur, such as changes in organizational structure and management reporting. As a result of the new organizational and segment structure that will be implemented in 2023, our asset groups are expected to be Ford Blue North America, Ford Blue Europe, Ford Blue Rest of World, Ford Model e, Ford Pro, Ford Credit, and Ford Next (formerly Mobility). \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required - Held-and-Used Long-Lived Assets. We test our long-lived asset groups when changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable. Events that trigger a test for recoverability include material adverse changes in projected revenues or expenses, present cash flow losses combined with a history of cash flow losses and a forecast that demonstrates significant continuing losses, significant negative industry or economic trends (including a substantial shift in consumer preference), a current expectation that a long-lived asset group will be disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life, a significant adverse change in the manner in which an asset group is used or in its physical condition, or when there is a change in the asset grouping. In addition, investing in new, emerging products (e.g., EVs) or services (e.g., connectivity) may require substantial upfront investment, which may result in initial forecasted negative cash flows in the near term. In these instances, near term negative cash flows on their own may not be indicative of a triggering event for evaluation of impairment. In such circumstances we also conduct a qualitative evaluation of the business growth trajectory, which includes updating our assessment of when positive cash flows are expected to be generated, confirming whether established milestones are being achieved, and assessing our ability and intent to continue to access required funding to execute the plan. If this evaluation indicates a triggering event has occurred, a test for recoverability is performed. \\n \\n When a triggering event occurs, a test for recoverability is performed, comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group. If the undiscounted forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, the asset group s fair value is measured relying primarily on a discounted cash flow method. To the extent available, we will also consider third-party valuations of our long-lived assets that were prepared for other business purposes. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value. When an impairment loss is recognized for assets to be held and used, the adjusted carrying amounts of those assets are depreciated over their remaining useful life. \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required - Held-for-Sale Operations. We perform an impairment test on a disposal group to be discontinued, held for sale, or otherwise disposed of when we have committed to an action and the action is expected to be completed within one year. We estimate fair value to approximate the expected proceeds to be received less cost to sell and compare it to the carrying value of the disposal group. An impairment charge is recognized when the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. \\n \\n Assumptions and Approach Used - Held-and-Used Long-Lived Assets. Fair value of an asset group is determined from the perspective of a market-participant considering, among other things, appropriate discount rates, valuation techniques, the most advantageous market, and assumptions about the highest and best use of the asset group. \\n \\n We measure the fair value of an asset group based on market prices (i.e., the amount for which the asset could be sold to a third party) when available. When market prices are not available, we generally estimate the fair value of the asset group using the income approach and/or the market approach. The income approach uses cash flow projections. Inherent in our development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results, business plan forecasts, expected growth rates, and cost of capital, similar to those a market participant would use to assess fair value. We also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions and other data. Many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management, and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods. \\n \\n Changes in assumptions or estimates can materially affect the fair value measurement of an asset group and, therefore, can affect the test results. The following are key assumptions we use in making cash flow projections: \\n \\n Business projections. We make assumptions about the demand for our products in the marketplace. These \\n assumptions drive our planning assumptions for volume, mix, and pricing. We also make assumptions about our cost levels (e.g., capacity utilization, cost performance). These projections are derived using our internal business plan forecasts that are updated at least annually and reviewed by our Board of Directors. \\n 88 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Long-term growth rate. A growth rate is used to calculate the terminal value of the business and is added to the present value of the debt-free interim cash flows. The growth rate is the expected rate at which an asset group s business unit s earnings stream is projected to grow beyond the planning period. \\n \\n Discount rate. When measuring possible impairment, future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted-average cost of capital that we anticipate a potential market participant would use. Weighted-average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall risk-adjusted pre-tax rate of return expected by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise. \\n \\n Economic projections. Assumptions regarding general economic conditions are included in and affect our assumptions regarding industry sales and pricing estimates for our vehicles. These macroeconomic assumptions include, but are not limited to, industry sales volumes, inflation, interest rates, prices of raw materials (e.g., commodities), and foreign currency exchange rates. \\n \\n The market approach is another method for measuring the fair value of a reporting unit or asset group. This approach relies on the market value (i.e., market capitalization) of companies that are engaged in the same or similar line of business as the reporting unit or asset group being evaluated. In addition, to the extent available we also consider third-party valuations that were prepared for other business purposes. \\n \\n During 2022, we continued to progress our global redesign. Against this backdrop, we determined that there were triggering events related to our South America and International Markets Group IMG business units. We also assessed our expected new 2023 asset groups, which consist of Ford Blue North America, Ford Blue Europe, Ford Blue Rest of World, Ford Model e, Ford Pro, Ford Credit and Ford Next and assessed these groups for triggering events and potential impairment. We determined that the carrying values of the long-lived assets were recoverable at December 31, 2022 under our existing assets groups as well as under our anticipated 2023 asset groups. If in future quarters our economic or business projections were to change as a result of our plans or changes in the economic or business environment, there was a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used, or there was a current expectation that a long-lived asset group will be disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life, we would undertake additional testing, as appropriate, which could result in an impairment of long-lived assets. \\n \\n Assumptions and Approach Used - Held-for-Sale Operations . In the third quarter of 2022, we entered into an agreement to sell our Sanand, India vehicle assembly and powertrain plants to Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Limited Tata ). The sale transaction included the land, buildings, and other fixed assets (excluding the powertrain machinery and equipment) for the plants. Accordingly, we have reported 88 million of fixed assets for this operation as held for sale for the period ended December 31, 2022. We recognized pre-tax impairment charges in Cost of sales of 32 million in the third quarter of 2022 to adjust the carrying value of the held-for-sale assets to fair value less costs to sell. We determined fair value using the market approach, estimated based on the negotiated value of the assets. On January 10, 2023, we completed the sale of the plants to Tata. See Note 22 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding held-for-sale operations. \\n\\nAllowance for Credit Losses \\n \\n The allowance for credit losses represents Ford Credit s estimate of the expected lifetime credit losses inherent in finance receivables as of the balance sheet date. The adequacy of Ford Credit s allowance for credit losses is assessed quarterly, and the assumptions and models used in establishing the allowance are evaluated regularly. Because credit losses can vary substantially over time, estimating credit losses requires a number of assumptions about matters that are uncertain. Changes in assumptions affect Ford Credit interest, operating, and other expenses on our consolidated income statements and the allowance for credit losses contained within Ford Credit finance receivables, net on our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding allowance for credit losses. \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required. Ford Credit estimates the allowance for credit losses for receivables that share similar risk characteristics based on a collective assessment using a combination of measurement models and management judgment. The models consider factors such as historical trends in credit losses, recent portfolio performance, and forward-looking macroeconomic conditions. The models vary by portfolio and receivable type including consumer finance receivables, wholesale loans, and dealer loans. If Ford Credit does not believe the models reflect lifetime expected credit losses for the portfolio, an adjustment is made to reflect management judgment regarding qualitative factors including economic uncertainty, observable changes in portfolio performance, and other relevant factors. \\n\\n89 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Assumptions Used. Ford Credit s allowance for credit losses is based on its assumptions regarding: \\n \\n Probability of default . The expected probability of payment and time to default, which include assumptions about macroeconomic factors and recent performance; and \\n Loss given default. The percentage of the expected balance due at default that is not recoverable. The loss given default takes into account expected collateral value and future recoveries. \\n \\n Macroeconomic factors used in Ford Credit s models are country specific and include variables such as unemployment rates, personal bankruptcy filings, housing prices, and gross domestic product. \\n \\n Sensitivity Analysis. Changes in the probability of default and loss given default assumptions would affect the allowance for credit losses. The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions for Ford Credit s U.S. Ford and Lincoln retail financing is as follows (in millions): Assumption Basis Point Change \\n Increase/(Decrease) Probability of default (lifetime) +/- 100 bps 210/ (210) Loss given default +/- 100 10/(10) \\n \\n Accumulated Depreciation on Vehicles Subject to Operating Leases \\n \\n Accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases reduces the value of the leased vehicles in Ford Credit s operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their expected residual value at the end of the lease term. \\n \\n Ford Credit monitors residual values each month, and it reviews the adequacy of accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis. If Ford Credit believes that the expected residual values for its vehicles have changed, it revises depreciation to ensure that net investment in operating leases (equal to the acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation) will be adjusted to reflect Ford Credit s revised estimate of the expected residual value at the end of the lease term. Adjustments to depreciation expense result in a change in the depreciation rates of the vehicles subject to operating leases and are recorded prospectively on a straight-line basis. \\n \\n Generally, lease customers have the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer. \\n \\n Nature of Estimates Required. Each operating lease in Ford Credit s portfolio represents a vehicle it owns that has been leased to a customer. At the time Ford Credit purchases a lease, it establishes an expected residual value for the vehicle. Ford Credit estimates the expected residual value by evaluating recent auction values, return volumes for its leased vehicles, industrywide used vehicle prices, marketing incentive plans, and vehicle quality data. \\n \\n Assumptions Used. Ford Credit s accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases is based on assumptions regarding: \\n \\n Auction value. Ford Credit s projection of the market value of the vehicles when sold at the end of the lease; and \\n Return volume. Ford Credit s projection of the number of vehicles that will be returned at lease-end. \\n \\n See Note 12 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases. \\n\\n90 \\n\\nItem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) \\n\\n Sensitivity Analysis. For returned vehicles, Ford Credit faces a risk that the amount it obtains from the vehicle sold at auction will be less than its estimate of the expected residual value for the vehicle. The impact of the change in assumptions on future auction values and return volumes would increase or decrease accumulated supplemental depreciation and depreciation expense over the remaining terms of the operating leases; however, the impact may be tempered or exacerbated based on future auction values in relation to the purchase price specified in the lease contract. A change in the assumption for an auction value will impact Ford Credit s estimate of accumulated supplemental depreciation if the future auction value is lower than the purchase price specified in the lease contract. The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions for Ford Credit s U.S. Ford and Lincoln operating lease portfolio is as follows (in millions): Assumption Basis Point \\n Change \\n Increase/(Decrease) Future auction values +/- 100 bps (10)/ 10 Return volumes +/- 100 5/(5) \\n \\n Adjustments to the amount of accumulated supplemental depreciation on operating leases are reflected on our balance sheets as Net investment in operating leases and on our income statements in Ford Credit interest, operating, and other expenses. \\n 91 \\n\\nItem 7.
